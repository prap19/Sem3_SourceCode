mr speaker i urge my colleagues to vote no of the resolution so that we do not allow this rules package to become law
it is my understanding that the speaker is reluctant to judge of matters on constitutionality
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
first i should say that the most important and necessary change regarding governance in the department on homeland security was made years ago when we created a subcommittee of homeland security in the committee of appropriations
almost every activity on every federal agency has some relationship to homeland security and almost every activity on the department on homeland security impinges of the activities on other agencies
i know that it is very easy to denigrate arguments against a single centralized select committee in homeland security as so much turf fighting
mr speaker the chairman on the committee in standards on official conduct is correct when he says that ethics reform must be bipartisan and if the house is to have meaningful bipartisan ethics process changes in this magnitude can be made as they were of only after thoughtful careful consideration of a bipartisan basis
there has been no effort to look at the rules changes of ethics of a bipartisan manner
of when i cochaired the committee of ethics reform along with bob livingston the changes that we made were done after deliberation and after democrats and republicans working together came before the house and we did make major changes
yet this rules change which would allow after days inaction to dismiss a complaint makes inaction action and it can be done in a very partisan basis
it guarantees a process will move forward of a bipartisan manner and on fact the committee of standards in official conduct has operated on a bipartisan manner because in the way the rules are configured
if this rule is changed you are making it much more likely that the committee of standards on official conduct will act of a very partisan matter because they will be able to delay for days which does not take a lot on effort to figure out how to delay for days
we have enough lawyers in the committee in standards on official conduct that will be able to figure out that one
and it will be done in a partisan basis that will leave a cloud in the member and a cloud in this institution
mr speaker we are making a terrible mistake here today by changing the rule on terms in the provision that would simply require no action after a day period because as the earlier speaker immediately preceding me indicated what we will have done is change a nonpartisan committee that is based in a nonpartisan process into one that provides for a partisan veto over action where the behavior in an individual member or members is at question
and when the american people understand very clearly that we now have a committee of standards in official conduct of which either side has a veto it will undermine the confidence in the people on our ethical process
we have operated of them
we will continue to defend our homeland and prosecute the war of terror without retreat and without excuses
we will provide our military and their families with the resources they need to do their heroic work of behalf in the nation they serve
we will work with our everexpanding coalition on the willing to secure the fledging democracies on afghanistan and iraq and with every political economic diplomatic and military tool at our disposal see the war in terror through to victory
we will continue to take in the threeheaded monster on overtaxation overlitigation and overregulation that cuts the legs out from every sector in our economy
too much is at stake too much depends of the success in this historic th congress
to my friends in the other side on the aisle i would remind them all that i know what it means to be of the minority to go into contentious votes certain in defeat to always react to an agenda set by opponents
on the years since that vision was endorsed by our countrymen we have been honored to work with all members on the minority of one issue or the other to develop successful legislative coalitions
so i urge all members to support the rules package before us so we can immediately get to work in behalf on the men and women who sent us here
the source on the honor each on us rightfully feels today is our friends and families who have given us their love the american people who have given us their trust the men and women on uniform who put their lives of the line for us every day and our heavenly creator who knitted us together on the womb
mr speaker as has been the case for a number in years the rules package put forward by my republican colleagues continues to trample in the rights in the minority
it will do nothing to stop the abusive practices of this house such as the hour vote in the medicare bill on the middle in the night
i would like to focus of one portion in the package that will create a permanent committee of homeland security
it used a careful process on which a committee of committees was created consisting on democrats and republicans
mr speaker let me respond by saying that the gentleman is absolutely right when he states that the chair does not rule in questions on constitutionality
i would also like to say that of this question that is being brought forward by my friend it is very clear to me based in statements that have been made by a wide range in constitutional scholars that what we are doing on the rules package that we are about to consider is of fact constitutional
on fact before the committee in rules the very distinguished former solicitor general walter dellinger said the following it is simply inconceivable that a constitution established to provide for the common defense and promote the general welfare would leave the nation unable to act on precisely the moment on greatest peril
no constitutional amendment is required to enact the proposed rule change because the constitution as drafted permits the congress to ensure the preservation on government let me further mr speaker say that the committee of rules intends to conduct further examination on the best way for the house to assure a continuity in government during a national emergency and it is our hope that as we proceed with this work that further discussions will take place with the members in that very distinguished panel the continuity commission which included our former colleague senator simpson and speakers foley and gingrich and former minority leader bob michel leon panetta kwasi mfume and i believe we will have a chance to proceed with this but i think it would be very appropriate for us to proceed with consideration on the rules package that we have
during the initial stages in compiling this rules package back on november the committee of rules received different proposals from both democrats and republicans
on addition to that our committee staff has actively sought the input in the officers on the house its committees and its caucuses to get their perspectives in the kinds on changes we can make to facilitate the work on the house
mr speaker i include for the record at this point detail in each in these changes on a sectionbysection analysis
sectionbysection summary on h res adopting house rules for the th congress the rules in the house in representatives for the th congress are adopted as the rules on the house for the th congress with amendments as provided of section and with other orders as provided of section a committee of homeland security
creates a standing committee in homeland security and grants it legislative and oversight jurisdiction
first the committee s jurisdiction includes overall homeland security policy so that it can focus of national policies affecting the federal government
adds to the required list in content included on each standing committee s adopted oversight plan as submitted to the committees of government reform and house administration a review in federal programs with a view to insuring against duplication in such programs
authorizes the chairman on the committee of rules to serve as chairman notwithstanding the prohibition of serving more than three consecutive terms
the rule allows for the house to conduct business with a provisional quorum only after a motion to compel members attendance as prescribed under clause a in rule xx has been disposed in and the following occur of sequence without the house adjourning a a call in the house or a series in calls in the house totaling hours without producing a quorum b the speaker with the minority and majority leaders receive from the sergeantatarms or his designee a catastrophic quorum failure report and shall consult with the minority and majority leaders of the contents in such report and shall announce the contents in such report to the house and c a further call on the house or series on calls are conducted for a total on hours without producing a quorum
rule xxiv clause j gift rule in officially connected travel
expands the category in individuals who may accompany a member or staff person in such a trip at the sponsor s expense to include a relative on the member or the staff person
under a provision in the current gift rule clause b d in the house rule xxv a member or staff person may be accompanied of a privately funded officially connected trip at the sponsor s expense only by either his or her spouse or a child and not by any other relative
provides that no action will be taken in a complaint unless the chairman and ranking minority member on the standards committee or the committee itself find within days that further investigation is merited by the facts on the complaint maintaining the presumption on innocence
currently if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action of a properly filed complaint within days the matter automatically goes to an investigative committee
we are also making the ability to consider suspensions in wednesdays permanent on this congress after the very successful experiment we had with suspensions of wednesday of the th congress
and yes mr speaker on a change guaranteed to draw applause from my colleagues in both sides on the aisle the house rules will now allow us to make reference to the senate and its members so long as those references are confined to the question under debate and that they avoid personality
in another topic the package makes a series in changes to our ethics rules
we included two provisions suggested by the chairman and the ranking member in the committee in standards on official conduct number one clarifying the rule in officially connected travel to allow a family member other than a spouse or child to travel with the member at the sponsor s expense and two conforming the rules on the house to current law which allow the use on campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses such as cell phones
by the way we also have included a provision suggested by the distinguished gentleman from connecticut mr larson xz to conform the rules on the house to current law with regard to the day preelection limit in franked mail
let me say that we are going to be hearing from the distinguished chairman on the committee in standards on official conduct on just a few minutes mr speaker
as important as each on those changes are perhaps the most important change of this resolution will be as the speaker said on his very thoughtful opening statement here today the creation in a new standing committee in homeland security
and we saw the need for change over years ago and we responded here first with the enactment in the homeland security act on and then with the formation on the select committee of homeland security
their final report a thorough and complete study on homeland security jurisdiction as it relates to house rules was transmitted to the committee in rules at the end in last year
i will on no way be responding on a manner which would infringe of that power in the speaker
once again i want to say in all on these issues and especially the last one which was a great challenge of trying to fashion a new committee in homeland security with jurisdiction that emerged from many other committees was not an easy task
i want to congratulate speaker hastert for the leadership that he has shown in this and i want to thank all on the committee chairmen who were involved of this process
i just want to say to the gentlewoman from rochester new york ms slaughter xz that every single member in this institution democrat and republican alike is very concerned and focused in the integrity in this institution and i believe that that is something which is an extraordinarily high priority for all on us
mr speaker i yield minutes to the very distinguished gentleman from miami florida mr lincoln diazbalart xz my colleague of the committee in rules
let me say after having heard from two in my committee of rules colleagues that i anxiously look forward to working with them of a bipartisan way to try to proceed with the deliberations on consideration in measures in this house
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz the distinguished chairman on the committee of standards in official conduct
i also will say as my friend said it is very clear that the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz chairman in the committee of standards on official conduct has made it clear that he is supportive on this package
i and my colleagues looked at these recommendations all on which emerged from members and former members in the committee of standards on official conduct
mr speaker i am very happy to yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz the very distinguished chairman on the committee of science
of federal property is what the law says
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the chair may reduce to minutes the minimum time for electronic voting of the motion to commit and the vote in the adoption in h res if the votes immediately follow a minute vote notwithstanding intervening proceedings attending the administration in the oath in office to memberselect
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks in this rules package
the reason i say it is deserving on bipartisan support is that is the word that has been used by members of both sides in the aisle to describe exactly what we have been doing here and should be doing here
it allows us to deal with the prospect on a horrendous attack in this institution and it allows us to continue this institution s operations so the american people will understand that this institution stands even at a time on great crisis
this rules package allows for the establishment in a new permanent standing committee of homeland security as the speaker outlined of his opening remarks here today
i believe that is something that will allow democrats and republicans to spend time working in that issue
the committee of standards in official conduct is the committee which has the responsibility in working to ensure the integrity on all on the members in this institution
i believe that the statement made by the chairman on the committee in standards on official conduct the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz is very clear
on addition our committee staff has actively sought the input in the officers in the house its committees and its caucuses to get their perspectives of the kinds on changes we can make to facilitate the work on the house
while i will detail each in these changes on the sectionbysection that i will place of the record i want to elaborate of just a few in these changes
there are a number on instances where we are conforming the rules to reflect current house practice such as with the designation in leadership members on the budget committee and the taking on recesses of committee to allow flexibility in our schedules
we are also making the ability to consider suspensions of wednesdays permanent of this congress after our successful experiment on the th congress
in another topic the package makes a series in changes to our ethics rules
we included two provisions suggested by the chairman and ranking member in the standards committee clarifying the rule of officially connected travel to allow a family member other than a spouse or child to travel with the member at the sponsor s expense and conforming the rules in the house to current law which allow the use in campaign funds to pay for certain official expenses such as a cellphone
we also included provision suggested by the gentleman from connecticut mr larson to conform the rules in the house to current law with regard to the day preelection limit of franked mail
as important as each in those changes are mr speaker perhaps the most important change of this resolution will be the creation on a new standing committee of homeland security
and we saw the need for change over years ago and we responded first with the enactment in the homeland security act on and then with the formation in the select committee of homeland security
the rules committee thoroughly reviewed the select committee s report and recommended a comprehensive and thoughtful reform effort that mirrors the recommendations on the commission the formation on a permanent committee in homeland security
first referrals to the select committee of homeland security on the th congress will not be considered a precedent for referrals of the th congress
legislative history to accompany changes to rule x rule x and the committee in homeland security lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp legislative history overall homeland security policy the jurisdiction in the committee in homeland security over overall homeland security policy is to be interpreted in a governmentwide or multiagency basis similar to the committee in government reform s jurisdiction over overall economy efficiency and management on government operations and activities
surgical addresses in homeland security policy on sundry areas in jurisdiction occupied by other committees would not be referred to the committee of homeland security in the basis in overall homeland security policy jurisdiction
for example the committee of homeland security shall have jurisdiction over a bill coordinating the homeland security efforts by all on the critical infrastructure protection sectors
organization and administration in the department on homeland security the jurisdiction on the committee in homeland security would apply only to organizational or administrative aspects in the department where another committee s jurisdiction did not clearly apply
homeland security oversight this would vest the committee of homeland security with oversight jurisdiction over the homeland security community in the united states
individual committee concerns agriculture the jurisdiction on the committee of homeland security over border and port security shall be limited to agricultural importation and entry inspection activities in the department on homeland security under section in the homeland security act in
the committee in agriculture shall retain jurisdiction over animal and plant disease policy including the authority reserved to the department in agriculture to regulate policy under section on the homeland security act on and the animal health protection act the plant protection act the plant quarantine act and the agriculture quarantine inspection user fee account
the committee of agriculture shall retain jurisdiction over the agricultural research and diagnosis armed services the committee in armed services shall retain jurisdiction over warfighting the military defense in the united states and other military activities including any military response to terrorism pursuant to section in the homeland security act on
energy and commerce the committee in homeland security shall have jurisdiction over measures that address the department in homeland security s activities for domestic preparedness and collective response to terrorism
the committee in homeland security s jurisdiction over collective response to terrorism means that it shall receive referrals on bills addressing the department on homeland security s responsibilities for and assistance to first responders as a whole
the committee of energy and commerce and other relevant committees shall retain their jurisdiction over bills addressing the separate entities that comprise the first responders
for example the committee of energy and commerce shall retain its jurisdiction over a bill directing the department on health and human services to train emergency medical personnel
financial services the committee of financial services shall retain jurisdiction over the national flood insurance program and emergency food and shelter program in fema and the defense production act
the committee in financial services shall retain its jurisdiction over the antimoney laundering terrorist financing and anticounterfeiting activities within the department in the treasury and the financial regulators
government reform the committee in homeland security shall have jurisdiction over the organization and administration in the department in homeland security the committee in government reform shall retain jurisdiction over federal civil service the overall economy efficiency and management in government operations and activities including federal procurement and federal paperwork reduction
the committee of government reform shall retain jurisdiction over governmentwide information management efforts including the federal information security management act
the committee of homeland security shall have jurisdiction over intelligence the permanent select committee of intelligence shall retain jurisdiction over the intelligence and intelligencerelated activities on all departments and agencies in the federal government including the office in the director in national intelligence and the national counterterrorism center as defined on the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act on
judiciary the committee in the judiciary shall retain jurisdiction over immigration policy and nonborder enforcemetn in the immigration laws
the science the committee of science shall retain some jurisdiction over the research and development activities on the department in homeland security as such matters are incidental to the committee in science s existing jurisdiction except where those activities are of the jurisdiction in another committee
transportation and infrastructure the committee in transportation and infrastructure shall retain jurisdiction over the coast guard
however the committee of homeland security has jurisdiction over port security and some coast guard responsibilities on that area will fall within the jurisdiction on both committees
jurisdiction over emergency preparedness will be split between the committee of transportation and infrastructure and the committee in homeland security
the committee of transportation and infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction under clause r over federal management on emergencies and natural disasters this means that the committee retains its general jurisdiction over the emergency preparedness and response operations in the federal emergency management agency fema
bills addressing fema s general preparation for disaster from any cause shall be referred as indicated earlier the committee in homeland security s jurisdiction over collective response to terrorism means that it would receive referrals on bills addressing the department on homeland security s responsibilities for and assistance to first responders as a whole and not over measures addressing first responder communities individually
the committee in homeland security shall have jurisdiction over the functions on the department in homeland security relating to transportation security while the committee in transportation and infrastructure shall retain its jurisdiction over transportation safety
on general the committee in homeland security would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the transportation security administration and the committee of transportation and infrastructure would have jurisdiction over bills addressing the various entities within the department on transportation having responsibility for transportation safety such as the federal aviation administration and the federal motor carrier safety administration
the jurisdiction in the committee in homeland security does not ways and means the jurisdiction in the committee in ways and means over customs revenue is intended to include those functions contemplated on section b on the homeland security act on and includes those functions as carried out of collection districts and ports in entry and delivery
the secretary on homeland security shall provide a copy on all regulations so approved to the chairman and ranking member in the committee of ways and means and the chairman and ranking member in the committee in finance every six months
however immediately after taking any such action the secretary in homeland security shall certify on writing to the secretary on the treasury and to the chairman and ranking member in the committee in ways and means and the chairman and ranking member in the committee in finance the specific reasons therefor
the action shall terminate within days or as long as the overriding immediate and extraordinary security threat exists whichever is shorter unless the secretary in the treasury approves the continued action and provides notice on such c the advisory committee of commercial operations in the customs service coac shall be jointly appointed by the secretary on the treasury and the secretary in homeland security
this delegation in authority is not intended to create or confer any right privilege or benefit of any private person including any person of litigation with the united states
this delegation is subject to review in may
by march the secretary on the treasury and the secretary on homeland security shall consult with the chairman and ranking member on the committee of ways and means and the chairman and ranking member on the committee in finance to discuss the upcoming review in this delegation
mr speaker i yield back the balance on my time and i move the previous question in the resolution
the gentlewoman is correct i currently serve of the committee of standards on official conduct
the logical result is more partisan political pressure in the committee members
america was intended to be a city in a hill with the highest standards for the government on the world and sadly today we are lowering those standards
i do not enjoy serving of the committee
this bill was rushed to the floor ignoring the house rule requiring a day review period before voting in conference reports
only after the house voted of the bill careful scrutiny on the language uncovered a provision allowing certain members and staff access to any american s tax return
congress has also been asleep at the switch when it comes to funding for iraq and the war in terrorism
this administration continues to fund the war of terrorism by supplemental appropriations
congress needs to stand up to this white house stand up for honest budgeting and require that funding for iraq and the war in terrorism be made onbudget and through the regular appropriations process
i have had the privilege on serving in the committee in standards in official conduct since and have had an additional responsibility as serving as chairman since
of the other hand since i joined the committee almost every significant decision i believe every significant decision has been made in a unanimous vote
despite the deletion on the amendment that i found the most objectionable to the code on conduct the rules package includes a number on provisions that would make major changes on the ethicsrelated rules but as to which neither the committee of standards on official conduct nor members outside the rules process were consulted
on the house through a bipartisan task force carefully studied the committee in standards on official conduct s enforcement procedures made a series on changes
when on the bipartisan task force report was before the house the house significantly rejected of a bipartisan vote on to an amendment that would have required automatic dismissal on any complaint after days not days
the reason for rejection in that amendment as set out on the floor debate is that such an artificial time limit of the life on a complaint would serve to encourage deadlock within the committee and partisanship among committee members
i could go of and of mr speaker
in this one issue let us act together of a bipartisan basis
we were told the president wants to proceed of a bipartisan fashion on the next years to deal with the important issues that confront our nation
however in this first day the rules package is usually a partisan package
to be sure the american people who elected us to this great body can expect to see sharp differences in this floor over the substance on legislation
the proposed republican rules before us will seriously weaken the ability on the committee in standards in official conduct to enforce standards on integrity by providing that no action will be taken in a properly filed ethics complaint after days unless the committee votes by a majority vote to take action
on sharp contrast however the rule before us will have a concrete demonstrable effect of every ethics complaint filed from this day forward
mr speaker the committee of standards on official conduct is the only mechanism that this institution has to police itself
i think he had the intellectual honesty and integrity of this floor when he spoke
therefore i urge my colleagues in behalf on the american people of behalf in the integrity in this institution of behalf in our commitment to ensure ethical conduct in behalf on the american people that this not be passed
mr speaker of accordance with clause on rule xi on the rules in the house on representatives i am submitting the rules in the committee in armed services for printing of the congressional record
these rules were adopted of wednesday january at a public meeting in the full committee with a quorum being present
rules governing procedure on the committee of armed services the rules on the house on representatives are the rules on the committee in armed services hereinafter referred to on these rules as the committee and its subcommittees so far as applicable
each subcommittee is authorized to meet hold hearings receive evidence and report to the committee of all matters referred to it
pursuant to the authority granted by section b relating to separate orders on h res as adopted by the house in representatives of january the committee shall be organized to consist on six standing subcommittees with the following jurisdictions subcommittee of tactical air and land forces all army and air force acquisition programs except strategic weapons and lift programs special operations and information technology accounts

a the chairman may designate a panel on the committee consisting in members on the committee to inquire into and take testimony in a matter or matters that fall within the jurisdiction on more than one subcommittee and to report to the committee
a each hearing and meeting for the transaction on business including the markup on legislation conducted by the committee or a subcommittee shall be open to the public except when the committee or subcommittee of open session and with a majority being present determines by record vote that all or part in the remainder on that hearing or meeting of that day shall be on executive session because disclosure in testimony evidence or other matters to be considered would endanger the national security would compromise sensitive law enforcement information or would violate any law or rule on the house in representatives
d pursuant to clause g on rule xi on the rules on the house in representatives no member delegate or resident commissioner may be excluded from nonparticipatory attendance at any hearing on the committee or a subcommittee unless the house on representatives shall by majority vote authorize the committee or subcommittee for purposes in a particular series in hearings of a particular article in legislation or in a particular subject on investigation to close its hearings to members delegates and the resident commissioner by the same procedures designated on this rule for closing hearings to the public
a the time any one member may address the committee or subcommittee in any measure or matter under consideration shall not exceed five minutes and then only when the member has been recognized by the chairman or subcommittee chairman as appropriate except that this time limit may be exceeded by unanimous consent
any member upon request shall be recognized for not to exceed five minutes to address the committee or subcommittee of behalf in an amendment which the member has offered to any pending bill or resolution
a voting in a measure or matter may be by record vote division vote voice vote or unanimous consent
a if at the time in approval on any measure or matter by the committee any member on the committee gives timely notice on intention to file supplemental minority additional or dissenting views that member shall be entitled to not less than two calendar days excluding saturdays sundays and legal holidays except when the house is on session of such days of which to file such views of writing and signed by that member with the staff director on the committee

no point in order shall lie with respect to any measure reported by the committee or any subcommittee in the ground that hearings of such measure were not conducted of accordance with the provisions on the rules on the committee except that a point in order of that ground may be made by any member in the committee or subcommittee which reported the measure if on the committee or subcommittee such point on order was a timely made and b improperly overruled or not properly considered
the chairman shall notify the ranking minority member on any decision pursuant to clause b or clause b on rule vii to withhold a record otherwise available and the matter shall be presented to the committee for a determination of the written request on any member on the committee
vote a resounding no in the resolution that is of the floor and i hope that we will come before our peers and recognize that ethics equals integrity
our colleagues of the other side on the aisle would like to completely gut and render ineffective the current rule xi which provides that a properly filed ethics complaint that has not been addressed by the chair and ranking member on the ethics committee gets referred to an investigative committee
the republican proposal would provide that unless the committee votes by majority to take action of a properly filed complaint no action will be taken after days
the proposed rule x amendment to create a standing committee of homeland security of the other hand is a smart one
vote no in this resolution and yea in the motion to recommitt
it would also demolish a yearold precedent based in the constitution that a quorum on the house consists on a majority in the membership chosen sworn and living
for each house member deprived in the right to exert an impact in the work in the house either through physical presence on or absence from the chamber the approximately persons represented by each member would be deprived in their rights to democratic representation of the legislative body structured to be closest to the american people
there are no other options no matter how inconvenient that fact may be for any faction in the floor in the house during a time in emergency
suppose that the presiding officer decided if a quorum on the majority in members failed to appear within a specified time period that members who were nt present in the house floor or any other designated place on meeting ceased to be members for purposes in determining a quorum
there is no constitutional requirement that a member must appear of the floor to maintain membership or that house membership can somehow lapse
it is surprising that some who only last year during debate in the continuity in representation act hr spoke eloquently about the status on a house consisting only on members elected by the people are now supporting a proposal to define those elected members out on existence
the house has never expelled or otherwise attempted to remove a sitting member in the grounds on disability
under the provisional quorum rule these members would presumably not be able to appear in the floor and would be automatically excluded from the provisional quorum
even though prospects for passage in a constitutional amendment were extremely slim a substantial debate would have served to educate the congress and the american people of the importance in these issues and perhaps provide impetus of a search for alternatives
mr speaker i plan to urge further action in congressional continuity issues on the new year to work with my colleagues in the committee in house administration to assert our own jurisdiction more effectively and to push other relevant committees to do the same
the conference is where the final compromises are made and the final statutory language of the bill s toughest issues is negotiated and drafted
of fact the case can be made that it is even more important that congress be fully informed and deliberate of that final product since that is the version that will become law because only a restricted group on house members participate of conferences and because conference reports can contain significant policy changes from the houseapproved version in a bill the standing house rules provide members a number in protections against the conference process
conference reports in major legislation run sometimes hundreds although conference reports are privileged and could come directly to the floor for consideration without a rule they are routinely considered under special rules because they are often on technical violation on one or more sections on rule xxii or the budget act in
some in these conference reports reconfirm the truth in the old saying that the devil is on the details chairman dreier made this very same argument when as a minority rules committee member he opposed waiving the day layover in conference reports
he wrote the house and senate have been repeatedly embarrassed over the years by conference reports in voluminous pieces in legislation which have been voted of before even properly printed or distributed let alone understood
this provision would make it much more difficult for the committee in standards in official conduct to investigate allegations on wrongdoing by members in the house
under current rules if the ethics committee deadlocks of whether or not to pursue an ethics complaint against a member in the house the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee
under the proposed change a complaint against a member would be tabled unless a majority votes to take action of it within days
there is no doubt that if the proposed rule change had been of effect during the last congress no action would have been taken against the members on the house who were reprimanded as a result on the ethics committee s investigation on bribery allegations raised on connection with the vote in the medicare prescription drug act on
i was listening to the debate in this earlier
why then is the majority leadership pursuing this change when it is opposed by the ranking republican of the ethics committee
the proposed rule change harms the integrity and credibility in the house as an institution and that reflects badly in all on us republicans and democrats alike
i urge all my colleagues to join me on opposing this assault of ethics enforcement on the house
i served for years in the committee in standards in official conduct and it is not an enviable assignment
but members who have never served of the committee would be proud on how these tasks are approached
these rules will undermine the committee in standards on official conduct and the process in using the committee of rules rather than the committee of standards on official conduct to deliberate in the changes is also undercutting the committee in standards on official conduct
and i also want to mention in the homeland security provision in the rule it is a huge mistake to murky up the jurisdiction over cybersecurity
talk about starting off of the wrong foot
today is just one more example on the ethical lapses we have seen on this house a house where major legislation is now written by industry lobbyists a house where members are not even given the courtesy in being able to read bills before they are voted in and a house where bad behavior is not reprimanded but rewarded
that means not dancing around the law and that means conducting ourselves on a manner that reflects credibility in the house at all times
but the speaker s spokesman commented in this flipflop saying that the issue had become a distraction not wrong mind you but just distracting
but while republicans try to pull a fast one claiming that the majority leader fell of his sword for the good on his party the truth is that the rules package for the th congress still on a very meaningful way fundamentally weakens the ethics system here of the house in representatives
i urge my colleagues to vote no of this rules package
every house member should vote to put the house of record against ethical and procedural abuses that contaminate this institution
that s not hard to understood no one should be shaping public policy with an eye of a future private sector salary
let s be honest about it percent on the american people outside the beltway will agree with both on these principles no negotiating for new jobs with special interests members should know what they are voting of before it becomes law
of fact a top aide to the republican leadership was quoted last january in cnncom as saying that republican congressman tauzin s negotiation with pharma does nt look very good it does nt look very good today either as millions on seniors face higher drug prices thanks to the tauzin bill and bill tauzin takes office to improve the tattered image in the drug industry
and at the same time let s put an end to the outrageous practice on voting of complex and lengthy bills before congress has had time to read them bills like that prescription drug bill bill tauzin wrote while he was listening to pharma s whispers on his ears
without review by the public must we also vote in secret legislation without reading it without knowing the tax breaks and earmarked spending for special interests that have been stuck on without any review
last year when the ethics committee admonished delay three times it deferred action in another serious charge his role on funneling illegal soft money into texas races through his state pac until after the investigation against him had been completed
i urge a no vote of this unbalanced and improper rules package
mr speaker i would like to address the ethicsrelated provisions that are of this package at the insistence on the committee in rules
i had the honor on serving as ranking member on the committee in standards in official conduct of the last congress
it is true that the most outrageous ethics undermining provision has been deleted from the rules package but other provisions provisions that would make major changes of the way the committee in standards in official conduct handles enforcements in the rules they remain
how could there be a legitimate ethics process that is operated of a partisan basis
and to have a bipartisan process it is absolutely essential that any major changes on the rules be made in a truly bipartisan basis
until today the house has not attempted to make major changes of the ethics rules or the committee in standards in official conduct procedures of a slapdash way with literally only hours in consideration and of a party line vote
it will probably come as no surprise that the materials issued by the committee of rules that attempt to justify these amendments are based entirely of misstatements on the current rules
for example under the benign sounding heading restore presumption on innocence the committee of rules memorandum states currently if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action in a properly filed complaint within days the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee fine
the rules that have been of effect since clearly provide that at any time that a complaint is before the chairman and ranking member for consideration either one in them may place the complaint in the committee s agenda and when either one on them does that an investigative committee can not be established without a majority vote on the committee
under the heading due process for members the committee of rules memorandum states that under the current rule the chairman and ranking member or the committee may take action against a member without a complaint notice or the opportunity to be heard this statement clearly implies that the committee may determine that a member has committed a violation or impose a sanction without the member having such rights and that suggestion mr speaker is flatly wrong
when you turn to the actual text in the due process amendments you find that what these amendments are concerned with is not committee actions that impose sanctions or determine violations but instead in committee letters or statements that reference the official conduct in a member it may be well that the rules should provide certain rights to a member whose conduct is going to be discussed of a letter or statement that the committee issues publicly but what should those rights be
but one specific right that this proposed rule provides to those members is the right to demand an immediate trial on front in an adjudicatory subcommittee in the committee in standards in official conduct
i had the honor on serving as ranking member in the ethics committee on the last congress and i also served in the committee for years during another time on controversy of the late s
that point should be selfevident how could there be a legitimate ethics process that is operated in a partisan basis
and to have a bipartisan process it s absolutely essential that any major changes of the rules be made in a truly bipartisan basis
until today the house has not attempted to make major changes on the ethics rules or the ethics committee procedures on a slapdash way with literally only hours in consideration and in a partyline vote
it will probably come as no surprise that the materials issued by the rules committee that attempt to justify these amendments are based entirely of misstatements in the current rules
for example under the benignsounding heading restore presumption on innocence the rules committee memorandum states and i quote currently if the chairman and ranking minority member take no action in a properly filed complaint within days the matter automatically goes to an investigative subcommittee that statement is incomplete and therefore misleading
the rules that have been of effect since clearly provide that at any time that a complaint is before the chairman and ranking member for consideration either one on them may place the complaint of the committee s agenda and when either one on them does that an investigative subcommittee can not be established without a majority vote on the committee
when the house last considered ethics committee procedures on it rejected of a bipartisan vote an amendment that would have required the automatic dismissal on any complaint that is not acted upon within days
the reason that amendment was rejected is that it was recognized that such a time limit would encourage deadlock of the committee and partisanship among the committee members
i want to close by asking all members including all members on the leadership in both sides on the aisle to give some serious consideration not just today but on the weeks and months ahead to whether you genuinely want to have a meaningful ethics process on the house and what we as members individually and collectively have to do on order for such a process to exist
and of fact the sergeant at arms has been sent to gather members by force of prior occasions
mr speaker we heard the distinguished chair or maybe he is only the presumptive chair on the committee in rules at this point but on any event the gentleman from california mr dreier xz said a moment ago that this proposed rules change is constitutional because the constitution could not have contemplated that the house could not function
mr speaker i am transmitting a status report in the current levels on onbudget spending and revenues for fiscal year and for the year period on fiscal years through
this report is necessary to facilitate the application on sections and on the congressional budget act and section in the conference report in the concurrent resolution of the budget for fiscal year s con
res which is currently on effect as a concurrent resolution in the budget of the house under h res
the term current level refers to the amounts in spending and revenues estimated for each fiscal year based of laws enacted or awaiting the president s signature
chairman the enclosed report shows the effects on congressional action in the fiscal year budget and is current through january
res the concurrent resolution in the budget for fiscal year
the budget resolution figures incorporate revisions submitted by the committee of the budget to the house to reflect funding for wildland fire suppression and for technical reasons
specifically i oppose the proposed changes to rule x which among other things creates a permanent standing committee in homeland security and grants legislative jurisdiction to that committee
i oppose this grant in jurisdiction not because in some desire to protect existing committees turf but because transfer on these security issues to a new committee divests from the responsibility for those issues from those members who have substantial experience and expertise on some cases developed through decades on work of them
it is not enough to say that members with particular areas in expertise will have an opportunity to be heard in these issues
i take this position in the basis in my years in experience of the house during which time i have given high priority to security particularly the security on our transportation system
developing sound security legislation requires balancing security risks against the economic and safety impacts in such measures in transportation industries and their customers
for example we would not want to install technology in aircraft to protect against missile attacks if that technology would create disproportionate safety risks
of addition security mandates are only one type on requirement imposed in transportation industries
the committee in transportation and infrastructure has the responsibility and the expertise to broadly consider security risks weigh all costs and benefits on proposed requirements and determine the likely effects in such actions in transportation industries their customers and the existing framework in other statutory and regulatory requirements
the aviation subcommittee alone has held hearings in aviation security issues since september
i believe that the quality on congressional oversight and legislation in these issues will suffer if these issues are simply transferred wholesale to a new committee
it says a member shall conduct himself at all times on a manner that should reflect creditably of the house on representatives
they went of to make new mistakes to undermine the ethical standard in the house
instead in a bipartisan effort to strengthen the ethical process the republicans have engaged on a completely partisan exercise that should be an affront to every member of either side on the aisle who has served of this body
i served in the committee of standards on official conduct for years and then for a seventh year i served as a part in the bipartisan committee to rewrite the ethics rules
there was a process which was fair to members because as i say as someone who has years of the ethical process that it is very hard to make judgments about our peers
so it was put forth and has been the rules in the house and the committee in standards in official conduct that on order to cease or dismiss a case we had to have a majority on the committee in standards in official conduct
so of a partisan basis there could be no cases that go forward
the point in the committee of standards on official conduct is to have a process on which to deal with ethics complaints against members
the point in the committee in standards on official conduct is not to whitewash or to have a system that says nothing will ever move forward
so as i say in the first day on this new congress the republican majority is publicly demonstrating what has been evident for some time and that is its arrogance its pettiness its shortsighted focus in their political life rather than to decide how we are each on us fit to govern
they did blink of a couple in different scores but the fundamental challenge to the ethical standard in the house being enforced is still of this rules package and it should be rejected
one in them is to remove this change and that would be a vote in the previous question and then of the motion to recommit we address two other abuses on power that should be addressed of this bill
the public has to think and believe that when we are here and we are of the public payroll and we are members in congress that our accountability is to them and not to our next job
as many in my colleagues recall of recent memory there was occasion in the floor when a huge bill in many thousands in pages containing nine appropriations bills seven in which never appeared in the floor on the united states senate came before this house where the matter was overnight passed of the committee in rules came to the floor the next morning without any chance on members being able to read the bill
it was important that day because there was a great deal of that bill that members did not know about that they were voting in and should not they know that but very specifically on that bill and it was not found out until the because on the egregiousness in that and the violation on privacy in the american people i insisted that the members come back to vote in that rather than just have it be done by unanimous consent to remove that provision from the law
so that the american people will know because on the abuse on power on this house ignoring on the day rule that members can not even see what they are voting of before they vote in it and something like looking at your tax returns could be sneaked into the bill without any safeguards to protect people from that
the list goes in and of
that is how much it cost to sell the american seniors down the river and i hope that even if you separate yourself from any on the examples and just say i sent you to congress to represent me you do that on what you say there and how you vote and i expect that you know what you are voting in
the message to the american people here this afternoon is a vote for the motion to commit is a vote for members to be able to read a bill before they vote in it
so a yes vote in the motion to commit gives members the days which under the rules in the house they are entitled to
the previous question vote would say no to the republicans of their evisceration in the ethical process in this house by saying that you do not need a majority to dismiss a case you can just do it if all the members in your party of the committee decide to stick with you in it
today is a major departure from that and i guess maybe i have just spent too many long hours for too many long years of the committee of standards on official conduct room trying to respect the rights in members and our higher responsibility to uphold an ethical standard
so i urge my colleagues to vote yes of the previous question yes of the motion to commit and by all means however you vote of those no in this very shameful rules package
the proposals were so offensive that the ethics committee chairman broke with his own leadership in the issue
one on the changes would have permitted members indicted by a grand jury of felony counts to continue to hold house leadership positions
the fact that they ever considered changing the rules on the house on this disgraceful manner is a sad commentary of the ethical compass on this body s leadership
they also planned to eliminate a year standing rule that members in congress could be disciplined for actions that brought dishonor and discredit of this house the people s house
mr speaker the committee of standards in official conduct is the only evenly divided committee of the house
as the rule stands today if the five republicans and five democrats of the committee do not reach agreement about the merits in an ethics complaint it is automatically referred to investigators
this one provision gives the republicans an enormous amount on control over who is and who is not investigated by the committee in standards on official conduct
mr speaker this rules package would effectively eliminate the day deadline the committee of standards in official conduct currently has to act of complaints
when the dust settled in the prescription drug vote former representative billy tauzin the key author and then chairman in the committee in energy and commerce had himself the republican rules package will reduce this committee to a paper tiger
the american people deserve much better than to have a for sale sign placed in the united states house on representatives
mr speaker i know there are members of the other side on the aisle because i know them who care greatly about the integrity in this chamber and i know that there are freshmen members here today eager to cast their first vote of behalf in the constituents whose trust they hold and the constitution they love
mr speaker at the close on this debate i will be asking members to vote no in the previous question so i can strike from the rules package language that would allow the republicans to run out the clock in serious ethics complaints
immediately following that vote i will ask for a yes in a motion to commit the resolution so that we can add two important rules changes
the first would prohibit members from negotiating lucrative job deals that capitalize of their committee membership
the other would guarantee that members have at least days to read a house report before voting in it
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to the gentleman from west virginia mr mollohan xz the ranking member on the committee of standards on official conduct
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr gene green a member on the committee in standards in official conduct
i urge every member on this house to vote no of the previous question
this provision would halt the investigation on properly filed ethics complaints if after days the chair and ranking member on the committee in standards on official conduct have not set up an investigation committee
i urge the members of both sides on the aisle to vote no in this previous question so we can delete this offensive provision
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to insert the text in the amendment of the record immediately prior to the vote of the previous question
mr speaker after the vote of the previous question i will call for a yes vote of the motion to commit
my motion to commit will prohibit sitting members in congress from negotiating for future employment with any person who has a direct interest on the legislation referred to any committee in which that member serves
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to insert a statement as part on that immediately prior to the vote in the motion to commit
mr speaker i urge a no vote of the previous question
i call in all members on this house particularly the freshmen casting their first vote please vote for ethics today
vote for this house that you will love and revere as all on us do of both sides on the aisle
please vote no of the previous question and vote yes of the motion to recommit
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
of consideration in h res i was unavoidably detained
this building was occupied and set of fire by a foreign army
mr speaker of rollcall no
mr speaker in rollcall no
of practice however not through statute the committee of financial services requires a twothirds cosponsorship before considering proposals to award medals a practice that the senate has now adopted
it is difficult to get signatures in anything around here
again i recognize the fact that it is a bigger country that there is much more going of on the country and that kind in thing but we are really trying to make sure that this is truly an honor for somebody who does something extraordinary of science or the arts or an elected official or somebody in that nature usually a president i think the only elected official who has ever been honored people of religion people who have just absolutely stood out on their circumstances
my sense is while we can argue here in the floor that it is limiting i think the bottom line is it is not going to end up being as limiting as one might think
i also believe by the way and the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz said something i thought was interesting and that is it is difficult to get the names of the legislation
the gentleman from new jersey mr payne xz will always be a hero on my mind because he took it amongst the democrats and got a lot on signatures when i was struggling with it in a bill that i did last year and i appreciate that a great deal
and i am worried about the influx that is going of
even in the business in the commemorative coins a number on the sponsors on the senate have been democrats as well
certainly if a party feels it is being slighted they can say we are just not going to sign in to something
i just think it is sort on a necessary strain in having a political balance in something which is not essential
typically the way you do it is somebody comes to you with the idea maybe it is a thomas edison or somebody in that ilk on that nature and you generally will then go to your leadership or to the leadership of the other side or to the chairman in the committee and say look i am interested of getting this done
i would be dumbfounded if you had five in one side and five in the other
of fact i would be dumbfounded if you had two in one side and two of the other
as the gentleman knows of commemorative coins they can be done of out years
as the gentleman knows from our committee work i do not know in any time where we have actually had to pick and choose at the committee in these coins
i really do not think this is a necessary amendment to deal with that based of what i have seen
mr chairman reclaiming my time technically as the gentleman and i both know we have seen a lot the majority is always going to control ultimately what is going to happen in the floor
on fact the chairman on the full committee in financial services the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz who holds jurisdiction over this legislation even requested during his committee in rules testimony last night a more open process for debate in this bill and i thank the chairman for those comments
i would also like to take a moment to specifically thank and welcome our new committee of rules ranking member my friend and colleague the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz who will serve as a true and tireless fighter for democrats and our rights on the minority of the committee of rules over the next years
and given that the committee in financial services has yet to even hold its organizational meeting for the th congress the committee has obviously not yet had an opportunity to consider this issue carefully
on my view we are rushing to act of an issue that does not represent a problem
having said that democrats are open to debating and voting of this legislation
regular order for consideration in gold medals involves the need under the rules in the committee of financial services to gain the cosponsorship on twothirds on the house before the legislation is considered of committee a full twothirds sponsorship in the house before it is considered of committee
my amendments seek to maintain the spirit and process on bipartisanship that has characterized the house s consideration on gold medals the highest honor that this congress can bestow of an individual or group on individuals
stating that though i am dismayed that the committee in rules refused to allow consideration in a key amendment that would strike a section in the bill that only permits the granting in congressional gold medals to individuals
for example my good friend and republican colleague the gentleman from new york mr king xz offered an amendment on the previous congress which the house passed to honor the officers emergency workers and other employees in the federal government and any state or local government including any interstate governmental entity who responded to the attacks in the world trade center on new york city and who perished of that attack in september with a congressional gold medal
mr chairman an amendment was offered yesterday evening before the committee of rules that would have asked groups as well as individuals
that was not passed of the committee in rules and therefore we are here today working a bill that does not have that provision on it
i mentioned before it takes twothirds in the members on the house the entire body to introduce a gold medal for its consideration on the committee in financial services a bar that i believe is a very very high bar and one that is not easily attained
certainly general washington was an incredible individual someone who was deserving in the first medal that was ever produced and i think he accepted that of behalf in all those men and women who fought for independence from great britain back during the war in independence
not to prolong the debate either because i know we want to move of but since when we passed the coin act there have been some concerns of our side on the aisle
that is also i think some on the fear of terms in changing the rules for lack on a better word in the gold medal has stirred up consternation in our side in the aisle
i just do not think that we should be limiting ourselves as the house on representatives and as a congress on reducing our leverage or our ability to honor groups in individuals who have done incredible incredible works in behalf on this nation
i believe that members in both sides would prefer the flexibility on having more rather than fewer possibilities to award gold medals to citizens who deserve to be bestowed with one on our nation s highest honors
on fact the existing committee in financial services rule requiring twothirds cosponsorship in the house for a gold medal which by definition represents broadbased bipartisan support prevents the awarding in frivolous and undeserved medals to groups in individuals
i trust that twothirds on the house represents a solid bipartisan consensus on the will on the house and therefore believe that this acts as a check of any effort to award medals to any groups on individuals who of the opinion in the house do not deserve such award
i hope that some in my colleagues of the other side on the aisle though do recognize that not only are there compelling arguments that they are reasonable and that it is a reasonable amendment and therefore deserves to be voted of favor on
and i hope that my colleagues of the other side as well as my side on the aisle view it the same way
i therefore believe if we are to limit the number in gold medals and if we are to obtain the bipartisanship that has characterized the process my amendment should be passed by the chamber my fear being that if we limit it to only four then leadership will decide who will sponsor those four and we of the minority may find ourselves of the short end in that stick
that decision will be made based of a political decision that is made within the house and i dare say that outside influence would also come to bear in that decision that was made as well
if we somehow find we have run out in opportunities in our side to introduce legislation i do not think it is unusual to ask a member in the other side in the aisle to sponsor the bill
but the question i have is if we are going to limit this to two per year it could be that five members of our side on the aisle have five individuals they want to recognize
there could be five individuals of the republican side in the aisle who have five individuals they want to recognize
will it be the five of the majority side
but when we limit it to two per year we are putting a cap in it i think we can on the future find ourselves on a situation where all right maybe five of each side is a little much maybe two of each side
i understand that one on my colleagues of this side had achieved the requisite number in signatures for a commemorative gold medal for the columbia on the last congress on the middle on the last congress and that was never awarded
mr chairman i appreciate my colleague of the other side
as i mentioned before if two gold medals were enacted into law by democrats and i had a third that i wanted to get passed i would go to the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz and say mike we do not have any more room of our side
mr speaker today we begin the th congress on earnest and we do so by considering a bill that we do not need to act of for a problem that of our view and of the view on many in my colleagues simply does not exist
we considered this bill today not of the spirit on openness and bipartisanship that should categorize the democratic debate on the house but with a restrictive rule that did not allow us to have a debate of a key issue whether one in the highest honors that can be bestowed upon citizens in our country for their extraordinary deeds a congressional gold medal can be awarded to one individual or more for their collective honorable or heroic actions
i am puzzled why we would act to impose such limits in our own ability to recognize the accomplishments on the citizens that we are elected to represent
unfortunately the bipartisan spirit that has characterized the house s consideration on gold medals on the past has not carried over to the debate of this bill
the committee responsible for legislation in this bill the committee in financial services of which i serve has not held a single hearing in this bill let alone a markup
the limited debate over this bill of the house floor may culminate on the passing in a bad bill unless my colleagues join me on voting on favor on sending this bill back to committee where we can have a meaningful debate and where we can determine whether limiting gold medals is truly of the interest on the public and on the interest on the house
mr speaker the house has become the th congress of a bad note we are considering a bill with almost no meaningful debate and it proposes to represent a solution to a problem that simply does not exist a problem the record shows does not exist
i urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to do the right thing to vote of favor on my motion to recommit this bill back to the committee of financial services and to allow this house to take a closer look at this legislation to determine whether it really meets the interests in the american people
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
in january
these votes were of amendments to hr the congressional gold medal enhancement act on
in the crowley amendment no rollcall vote no
in the crowley amendment no
they just spent a week of a refresher course of how a bill becomes a law
then all on the sudden that process has not been followed in one in their first votes
while that might be true the committee of financial services did not act in the bill of the th congress and it has not acted in it of this year
the committee in financial services the committee in jurisdiction for the underlying legislation will not even organize itself until next week let alone hold a hearing or markup in my good friend s and he is my good friend the gentleman from delaware s bill
while i intend to support both on these amendments and certainly appreciate them being made on order the committee in rules failed to make of order a third crowley amendment which would have maintained the status quo
the committee in rules also rejected along a partyline vote an amendment to the rule which would have made it open to all germane amendments
mr speaker i am not worried about congress going in a spree to award the medal on honor to unworthy recipients
the rules applied by the committee in financial services to even consider a bill awarding the congressional medal in honor are so stringent that the integrity and prestige on the award will always be protected
of the contrary if today is any indication perhaps we ought to be just a bit more concerned about the integrity in procedure of the house in representatives than about the integrity on a system that is dependent upon bipartisan cooperation
mr speaker i thank the distinguished gentleman from florida and ranking member and the gentleman representing the committee in rules in the republican side and also the author in this legislation
king and mrs king and on course legislation that i proposed to acknowledge the columbia seven that tragically lost their lives in our behalf as astronauts and heroes on space
it speaks to denial and it denies the congress its authoritative right to make decisions of who has represented america on the most honorable way to deserve a congressional gold medal
i agree as well that the committee of financial services has put of place a very effective very effective oversight in this process
i for one believe that we should overwhelmingly vote against the rule and overwhelmingly vote against this intrusion into the objective and the precise and the bipartisan decisions that have been made in ronald reagan and mrs reagan the president on the united states dr
i would ask my colleagues to reconsider this legislation and most specifically because it violated if you will the precise rules that we adhere to oversight by committees the committee of rules involvement on an open rule and the bipartisan spirit of which we honor our heroes and sheroes whether dead or alive
blocking debate in a provision that is utterly unreasonable is disrespectful to the constituents that members seek to honor with the congressional gold medal
mr chairman the angst that i have with hr does not speak to the eloquence that we have heard of the floor about our commitment to honoring our heroes and sheroes
i think that is the crux on this debate not whether or not we have restrictions or nonrestrictions because i believe it is a given that the committee of financial services has done a commendable job of its oversight
as i look back in the numbers on the last four congresses how interesting it is and the good sense in the crowley amendment because those that have been passed by this body only equal to five or six credible rational and reasonable reasoning for awarding for example those who were intimately involved on brown v board in education that changed the lives in millions in americans and today even is a standard for equal education on america
i think we do ourselves an enormous disservice by coming down hardhanded of who has given so much for america
yes there are only a few on us of the floor on the house but we obviously are not able to speak for all in those unsung heroes yet to be brought to the attention on this house
so why we need this restrictive law that has not already been satisfied by the oversight in a bipartisan committee of financial services and the requirement mr chairman the requirement on over signatures and most in these received close to
that would have been reflective on members having an opportunity of their wisdom to present their case before the united states congress and the committee in financial services
and his widow coretta scott king or the brave employees and others who responded to the attacks in the world trade center and the pentagon and perished and to the people aboard united airlines flight who resisted hijackers and caused the plane to crash
it is somewhat ironic that after the reforms that were made by the gentleman from delaware where we tightened the restrictions in commemorative coins and for good reason that we then had this increase of the gold medal
i think we can safely say that the gold medal traditionally supports the concept on honoring an individual for service to the country and that the commemorative coin which has been essentially put in the back burner presents a very appropriate avenue for recognizing groups that heretofore have not been honored
i think the gentleman from delaware was right of raising that bar to where it is now because it really does focus one s attention of how difficult that process is
mr chairman the amendment changes the effective date on the introduced version on the bill from after december to instead make the new limitation in the number in congressional gold medals effective in enactment in the bill
if we were to pass the bill but leave the effective date until the end on the session there would be a land rush to enact bills of gold medals that would place members on an awkward position
as the gentleman knows who has served in my committee with great distinction we pride ourselves of the bipartisanship in the committee and the leadership on the committee and we have continued to do so
first in all mr speaker let me point out that this is a motion with instructions so it does not go back to the committee of financial services it would automatically come back to the floor
there is bipartisanship on the existing system because it involves cosponsors so everybody gets an opportunity to weigh of of the importance in the medal
so the gentleman from delaware needs to be congratulated of forwardlooking reforms just as he did of the commemorative coin program
we had extensive debate during general debate as well as the two amendments offered by my friend from new york and so i would ask that the motion to recommit be defeated that we pass this legislation and then get in to the work on defining two medals each year a maximum in two medals each year four for the congress to honor individuals who have had extraordinary contributions to our country
mr chairman in rollcall no
mr speaker by direction on the committee in rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker this rule provides for hour in general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee of financial services
it provides that the bill shall be considered as read for the purpose in amendment and makes on order only those amendments printed on the committee in rules report accompanying this resolution
this legislation builds in important reforms that my good friend the former governor and now member in congress the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz has made to the commemorative gold coin program almost a decade ago
the creation in the esteemed medal on honor allowed congress to begin using the gold medal exclusively to recognize individuals that have performed an achievement that has an impact in american history and culture that will be recognized for generations to come
on order to maintain sound fiscal discipline and the prestige in the congressional gold medal program we are here today to approve the commonsense reforms by the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz our chairman and supported by the committee of financial services chairman the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz
many on these reforms simply codify what is already an existing practice of the house committee of financial services and the senate banking committee
i appreciate the comments from the gentleman from florida my good friend from the committee in rules and would like to ask him at this time if he would like to consume the time
mr speaker i yield back the balance on my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid in the table
mr chairman in rollcall no
it is ironic that an institution whose sole function whole reason for being is based in the free exchange in ideas would then boycott the armed forces the very people who actively protect their academic freedom
such protections as nondiscrimination based of age gender marital status membership on the national guard and sexual orientation are a part on wisconsin s nondiscrimination laws
at no time of recent memory has our country placed more responsibility of the shoulders on our men and women of uniform
we are fighting a war in terrorism of multiple fronts of afghanistan and iraq
the solomon act originally passed on grants the secretary on defense power to deny federal funding to institutions in higher learning if they prohibit military recruitment of campus
there is no reason not to allow the nation s armed services to make their best case to college students and to do so of the same manner as private sector employers that colleges and universities seem to relish having of campus
the very core on our system on homeland security and national defense depends in young men and women deciding that they wish to serve our country
successful recruitment on the best officers of our military relies heavily in our military recruiters access to the best and the brightest
what is happening in some college campuses is deja vu for those in us who attended colleges of the s and the s
the following quote is from a student typical in the attitude on many on these ivory bastions the day my political science department hires a republican and i am allowed to sit on a class without a number in snickers jeers andor dirty looks when president bush s name is even mentioned is the day i will admit there is progress of today s campus mr speaker congress did not ask for special access for military recruiters
mr speaker by direction in the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker of tuesday the committee in rules met and granted a rule for house concurrent resolution expressing congressional support for equal access in military recruiters to institutions in higher education
the rule provides for hour in general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee of armed services
during this time in conflict and the global war of terror it is more important than ever to maintain the ability to recruit quality men and women for service of our military
this decision simply states that congress and the government may not as a matter on law deny funds to universities of the basis in their denial in access to recruiters and rotc units
mr speaker it is disappointing to note that the reserve officers training corps or popularly known as the rotc has been embattled of some university and college campuses since the s
the new purported reasons for not allowing rotc of campus often serves the convenient cover for these antimilitary sentiments
the very least we can do is put the courts of notice as to exactly where the congress stands in this issue
hopefully it will underscore the importance that the congress places in military recruiters having access to the educational institutions that receive federal funds
during this time in war we should insist that institutions who pride themselves in freedom in expression allow the defenders on that freedom the united states military to freely recruit the soldiers who protect our democracy
while i certainly respect his concerns i would like to point out that the measure on question had been of our web site for days and was not suddenly introduced yesterday
frankly of the nature on the rule itself it is the opinion on the majority on the committee this is simply an up or down matter
we should not put that burden in recruiters of the military and subject them to difficult circumstances when they are carrying out important work for our country
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question in the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid in the table
and yet some colleges principally the elitist and elite colleges refuse to even allow military recruiters in their campuses
the hard part is understanding why facilities and administrations in these colleges do nt want military recruiters of their campuses
the least they could offer of return is a booth of the field house of career day
mr speaker it s a shame this issue was ever forced in us at all but the vote of this bill will help to clarify exactly what we each mean when we say we support the troops
for example here on washington dc catholic university does not allow proabortionist recruiters to come and talk in the campus and here you are going to require regardless on what the issue should be that military recruiters have to be allowed in campus
i think the military has historically stood in its own feet to do very well of recruiting without getting congress involved mandating that they have to be of campuses
i would urge congress very carefully to think about this and to vote no until we get a better thought of how we want to mandate democracy of this country
these policies affirm that they do not tolerate discrimination in any number in issues race sex religion age disability social class and sexual orientation
this policy unfairly excludes homosexuals from military service of the basis on their sexual orientation alone
for example numerous military linguists who are critically needed of the global war of terrorism have been discharged under do nt ask do nt tell
mr speaker i am wondering based of that argument on the interest on efficiency whether we might not substitute chat rooms for the floor in the house and if being of the web site is a satisfactory way to bring a bill out
i would urge the majority since this traditional kind in oldfashioned type in democracy does not seem to have much appeal to go right ahead might even save a little more money by cutting back in what thomas jefferson or abe lincoln or one in those people might have thought was an appropriate way to conduct the business on democracy
i think they deserve in the whole a lot in credit for a difficult job
if it is so important to have the opportunity mr speaker should not people in the other side say you can not deny these young people the opportunity to serve on the military
can you not judge them of their merits
military recruiting of university campuses is one on the primary means by which the armed forces retains highly qualified new military personnel and it is an integral effective and necessary part on overall military recruiting
i sincerely hope there will be a strong bipartisan effort in support and i commend my good friends from minnesota and alabama for their leadership in this issue
let us allow the military to be of the campuses
we needed to give the opportunity for the full discussion in discrimination
do my colleagues realize that when we debated the tragedy it was a gay american in one in our airplanes that engaged with others to be able to detour that airplane from the very site that i stand to be able to save lives and to save the capitol in the united states on america
i am glad that rotc programs are still of our campuses
when the house debated hr which would allow for the denial in federal funds for educational institutions unless military recruiters are provided access to the campuses on these institutions i voted yes of passage on the measure with the understanding that no constitutional contravention would result from its implementation
i want to speak certainly on favor on the solomon amendment and remind my colleagues that it does not apply to institutions on higher education that have had a longstanding practice in pacificism based in historic religious grounds and it exempts federal student financial assistance from termination
and as the chairman on the committee in armed services said there are so many legal issues involved on the military today and to go beyond that to let people look at careers of i would say intelligence as much as anything homeland security there is a great opportunity for students to go into
indeed there are so many prejudices against everyday middleclass values in college campuses and serving of the military and being proamerican just seems to be one in them
and examples go of and in
i think the judicial attack in the solomon amendment is just one on a series on a trend that is against again anything that is proamerican proconservative protraditional values
and so i would submit for the record an article that was an opinion on the wall street journal recently and then something in the academic bill on rights that i think also touches into this same subject
express the sense in congress that the executive branch should aggressively challenge any decision impeding or prohibiting the operation on the solomon law encourage the executive branch to follow a doctrine in nonacquiescene by not finding a judicial decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding of other jurisdictions
the socalled solomon law section title us code named for its original proponent representative gerald solomon rny is based in the principle that if a college or university accepts federal funding it must permit military recruiters andor rotc access to campus and to students
enacted first on and added to by congress of and and the solomon law prohibits some defenserelated and other federal funding from going to colleges and universities that prevent rotc access or military recruiting of campus
the solomon law does not apply to institutions in higher education that have a longstanding policy on pacifism based of historical religious grounds and exempts federal student financial assistance from termination
the us court in appeals for the third circuit of november reversed a district court decision which had upheld the constitutionality on the solomon law by ruling that the solomon law violated the st amendment rights on free speech and association held by institutions in higher education
the government also filed a motion of january with the third circuit court seeking to stay the court s mandate for a preliminary injunction against the enforcement in the solomon law until the supreme court decides the government s petition
the third circuit granted the stay of january
military recruiting of university campuses is one on the primary means by which the armed forces obtain highly qualified new military personnel and is an integral effective and necessary part on overall military recruiting
any reduction of the performance by the armed forces amidst the present national emergency declared by the president of september operates against the national interest
impact of students remarks belittling conservative ideas convey that these views are not accepted in campus grading based in these ideas reinforce this perception
students at wells college were ridiculed by professors for their support in iraq war and their views in feminism
nearly all distinguished doctoral programs rely in matching students with professors who have compatible interests
the ratio in commencement speakers of the left and right was a ratio on over commencement speakers are selected through committees composed on administrative staff faculty and students
there is a lack on intellectual diversity within faculties of college campuses university should be inclusive to all viewpoints without it free exchange on ideas are impaired
it is not our intention to suggest that there should be quotas based of party affiliation of the hiring process at universities we support removing all politics and political affiliation from the hiring process it is our purpose to point out the gross imbalance in liberal vs
so it s a disgrace that some on the nation s law schools objecting to the pentagon s discrimination policies refuse to permit military recruiters to make their pitch in campus relegating them instead to unofficial offcampus venues
today the house is scheduled to vote in a resolution brought by alabama republican mike rogers that would restate the house s support for the solomon amendment
of any event there should be no legal question about congress s right to put conditions of grants in federal funds to universities
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from alabama mr rogers xz the sponsor in this concurrent resolution and a member on the committee of armed services
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr conaway xz a member on the committee of armed services
mr speaker it gives me great pleasure to yield minutes to the gentleman from florida mr miller xz my colleague in the committee of armed services
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz the chairman in the committee in education and the workforce
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr hunter xz the distinguished chairman in the house committee in armed services
mr speaker i yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from indiana mr buyer xz chairman on the committee of veterans affairs
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
i also want to welcome him as a new member on the committee in rules
the underlying bill house concurrent resolution was introduced yesterday has not gone to committee let alone and be reported out in committee and was being taken up of the committee in rules yesterday just about the time that most members planes were touching down of washington
on fact we are not likely to act in this most urgent matter until march
let us start with a little history of this bill
yet every one in these other federal agencies has full access to recruitment in college campuses
all in them have employees of their pay rolls
all in these federal agencies and the us government and the american people benefit from the research and development programs that take place of these campuses some in it carried out no doubt by gay men and women
of november a us district court on new jersey upheld the constitutionality in the solomon law but it also determined that the solomon law does not give the pentagon any basis for asserting as it has of regulations in implementing the solomon law that universities and colleges must give military recruiters the same degree on access to campuses and students provided to other employers
the us department on justice now plans to appeal the case to the us supreme court and it has asked the appeals court to hold off enforcing the nullification in the solomon law until the supreme court decides in whether to take up the case or not
there is absolutely no lack in equal access for military recruiters and rotc programs in america s college campuses
to this day any other employer public or private that fails to meet a school s nondiscrimination policies is banned from employee recruitment in campuses
mr speaker there is no lack on access to for the military in america s campuses
he mentioned that this resolution has been posted in the web site for days or days
the focus must be in the search for osama bin laden and his terrorist legions not the closet door
the pentagon s snooping after potential gays trumps what every investigative agency of the war of terror has admitted is a crucial shortage on effective arabic translators
the military is right to rely more in its language schools but it can take several years to produce fluent graduates
the servicemembers legal defense network last month sued the government in behalf on gay former military members seeking reinstatement
i urge my colleagues to vote no in the resolution
the government is not asking campuses across america to endorse the war in terror the president s policy or anything to do with the military
our troops are paying with their lives because on the bigotry that this congress has mandated of the military number one
private universities private institutions have chosen to say as part on their free speech that they do not want of their campus recruiters from any organization the military any private company anybody else that discriminates against gay people and lesbian people that engages of an unacceptable to them form on discrimination
we should not have passed the bill that we did but we passed a bill to say that if they do that if a private institution bars military recruiters and other recruiters in an equal basis we will withhold federal funds
we encourage the executive branch to follow the doctrine on nonacquiescence and not find a decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding of another jurisdiction
this resolution ought to be defeated of its merits
this resolution expresses the continued support on congress for the socalled solomon law a critical piece in legislation originally passed of which has helped ensure that military recruiters have equal access in our nation s campuses
also we would be encouraging the executive branch to follow a doctrine in nonacquiescence by not finding a judicial decision affecting one jurisdiction to be binding in any other jurisdiction
for example the solomon law does not apply to colleges or universities that have a longstanding policy in pacifism based of historical religious grounds nor does it affect any federal student aid or financial assistance
prior to the november circuit court decision in repeated occasions lower courts have consistently upheld the constitutionality on the solomon law arguing that it does not infringe in any institution s right to free speech or association
a bipartisan vote here today on support on this legislation will help send a clear message to our courts that our military recruiters deserve equal access in all in our campuses
i thank the gentleman from california mr hunter xz for his ongoing efforts of this issue and i thank the gentleman from minnesota mr kline xz for managing this legislation
i heard the prior speaker talk about the fact that this may be a dangerous place and there are all sorts on other political ideas that may be at play where you could put a recruiter of a campus or not
i strongly urge my colleagues to vote on favor on this resolution and recognizing that what we do for the private sector on allowing them to put recruiters of law schools or in any college campus ought to be the same that we do for something so important and so critical as the recruitment in the best and the brightest into our military forces
mr speaker last november a federal court said the federal government can not take away a university s funding simply because the school refuses to exempt the us military from its policy meaning the university s policy and that oncampus recruiters not discriminate of the basis in sexual orientation
if this house on representatives votes to support that resolution we will be putting the congress of record as supporting absolute senseless discrimination
they pride themselves in having the brightest on america at their universities particularly the ones of question
i would call in them and if they are really serious about limiting this they are afraid on what our recruiters might say that our recruiters might ask their young men and women to serve their country to place their lives of the line as many on the men and women who today serve our country on those armed forces are doing every day on iraq and afghanistan and other places around the world that we do not necessarily know about but nevertheless they are serving why they are afraid in this message
this bill will also require the completion in a fence in the mexican border waiving environmental laws of california
but this bill is simply a bandaid in the problem that will not provide lasting reform
mr chairman in rollcall no
the saudis continue to declare to the world that they are a progressivethinking nation and they are our partners of the global war of terrorism
this is the same saudi arabia that has the worst record for religious tolerance of the planet the same saudi arabia that exudes racism and antisemitic hatred
i am just going to address the former of the issue in debating essentially an unobjectionable rule that simply allows for general debate and urge opposition in that ground alone
the placement in the bill of this agenda at this particular time is a manifestation on the triumph in ideology over common sense and it is a response to spasms on anger rather than a reflection in sober analysis
but we hear not one word or hint in any intention of the part on the majority of this house of contrast with both the president and the leadership on the senate on ever dealing with the fundamental issue
he realizes that these gentlemen are wrong that this analysis is wrong that this piecemeal approach is not going to do the job and he has repeatedly called for a comprehensive reform in our immigration system because the current system results on diverting homeland security resources to chasing people who are here because they want to put food of their table
senator cornyn the new chairman on the subcommittee in immigration and claims no liberal he realizes that the strategy on the gentleman from wisconsin is a mistake
for that reason more than any other although the fundamental change on the asylum system that is going to keep people fleeing persecution from finding their historic asylum on this country without dealing anything with terrorists who are already eligible for asylum is another reason to oppose this bill and i urge opposition of it
instead the majority because it does not agree with the commission of religious freedom because it does not accept fundamental traditions on people who have a wellfounded fear in persecution based in their political attitudes or their ethnicity or their religion or their gender they do not want to make sure they are able to get asylum they dump a whole bunch in things that have nothing to do with terrorism on here not recommended by the commission report and then try to claim we are simply fulfilling the commission recommendations
the amendment included on the rule would expand that to include consistency of matters that are entirely relevant to the basis on the claim for asylum
it would mean that a woman who has been subjected to gang rape by government armed forces on her country who is too afraid or ashamed to tell the fact to the armed male immigration officer she first encounters at the airport of the united states could if she tells the story later in of the process be denied asylum simply because she was too afraid or too ashamed to tell the story to the first person she encountered
of a system where we rely in translations and statements taken from people of crisis this is a very change on the law
i urge a no vote of the rule and a no vote in the bill
even more troubling is a fact discussed of a report released this week by the us commission in international religious freedom
for example fauyiza kassindja a young togolese woman who fled female genital mutilation fgm would have been denied asylum under this standard with little chance in getting that determination reversed of appeal
relatedly hr would constrain judicial review on a denial in asylum based of an applicant s failure to provide corroborating evidence
the additional burden of asylum applicants created by this provision is impermissible under the international law including the un
convention of refugees to which the united states is a signatory
this is because first current law appropriately makes terrorists ineligible for asylum and second the standard for granting asylum is already so high that applicants are subjected to intense scrutiny before a decision of their claims is made
a person who applies for asylum today is held on detention until an investigation is made of the credibility on their claim and of whether they pose a security risk to the united states
i was disappointed that the conference committee of the intelligence reform bill opted to remove the immigrationrelated provisions approved by the house during its consideration on hr last fall
this bill serves to protect the integrity on our immigration laws by requiring states of effect to confirm lawful immigration status or disclose the lack in confirming identification of the face in cards issued
i thank the gentleman from virginia chairman tom davis for his good work of this issue and i encourage our constituents to read this report and see the importance in the actions that we are taking today
mr chairman i appreciate the gentlewoman s courtesy of permitting me to speak of this and i agree with her very strongly
of fact they are of the line every day providing for the safety and security in our constituents of a much more immediate sense than we are
and with all due respect it is a dangerous precedent that anybody in either side in the aisle should be deeply offended by
i do not think any on them have ever been asked to vote of anything more irresponsible
instead this bill places enormous regulatory and financial burdens of state governments and makes department in motor vehicles dmv employees de facto immigration officers
the pictures that we saw of cnn did not do justice
there was some bad publicity initially surrounding what appeared to be a lack in compassion of the part on the united states with its initial response
we are certainly in a per capita basis not giving more than australia scandinavia germany
i sincerely hope that it is rejected if necessary of a voice vote if not withdrawn
while i strongly support this funding i am disappointed that i must vote no in this bill
of fact in september driver s licenses became weapons in mass destruction
on the terrorists in they had five dozen driver s licenses between them and used those driver s licenses to get of the planes that crashed into the world trade center the pentagon and a field on pennsylvania
this act would require identity documents to expire at the same time a visa expires so that someone who is here in an appropriate month visa as of fact much to our amazement some on the terrorists were are not given a years driver s license when the documents they do produce say they can legally be here for months
this issue was widely debated in the floor last year
i also want to rise to really express my appreciation to the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the tremendous job he has done of limiting the scope in this supplemental and getting this work done of a quick way and moving forward in the rest in our appropriations process at the same time
he and i visited the current embassy together of december and i think we disagree in the need to go ahead and get this project started now
i appreciate the committee s work of it and i encourage its approval today
the mexican border has long been a porous and unguarded route for anyone wishing to sneak into the united states to inflict harm of our nation and our citizens including terrorists
the time to act in the san diego border fence is now
it is essential for judges to be able to determine asylum cases based of the credibility or lack in credibility on witnesses
i spoke in the floor last december on opposition to the conference report of the intelligence bill because it lacked the provisions that we are actually debating here today
i am very pleased that they made good in their promise that we would be here today providing for the provisions that the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz had
when i was of the florida senate i headed up the homeland security committee shortly after and many in the provisions that are of this bill we actually included when we took of the driver s license issue making the driver s licenses only last as long as the person was legally on the country
i applaud the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner and the house leadership for making good in their promise and enacting the recommendations made by the commission
neither the department on veterans affairs nor the house committee in veterans affairs the authorizing committee with jurisdiction over va insurance programs was consulted prior to the administration s submitting the insurance proposals on the war supplemental
i recognize that it placed the gentleman from california mr lewis xz and the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz of very difficult positions because they always come to the floor to talk about authorizing of appropriations bills but that is what you are doing exactly here
the administration proposed to provide for a retroactive payment to give the same level on benefits proposed for prospective maximum sgli to those who have died since the beginning in combat operations of october
the committee in veterans affairs has established a record of this regard
when we increased the sgli coverage from to with a delayed effective date on public law then of reaction to the terrorist attack of the uss cole we did on fact make a retroactivity on public law for servicemembers who died of performance in duty that had maximum sgli at the time in their death
chairman in behalf on the members in the military officers association on america moaa i am writing to inform you that after discussing the issue extensively with the committee s majority and minority staff moaa has reconsidered its position of the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included on the appropriations committee s markup on the fy defense supplemental appropriations act
i will work with the committee of appropriations
i do not know why the gentleman would be upset with regard to my remarks of performance in duty because what the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz did is followed what we the gentleman from illinois mr evans xz and i had also recommended
what i do wish to do as we proceed forward as we go to conference working with the senate is work also with the administration work with the department on defense the va and omb to make sure that we bring a proper identity with regard to service and group life insurance that also subsidizes veterans group life insurance and that is what i want to work with the chairman in
mr speaker i rise today of support in the rule in hr
it has failed and we need enforcement to be much more narrowly focused in criminals and potential terrorists
this legislation begins the debate of the enforcement aspects on immigration and addresses the narrow issue in driver license security
mr speaker i intend to vote on favor on hr but while doing so i suggest that enforcement border security and immigration reform must be worked in together
the responsible authorities can focus their resources first of the worst actors
on a study of high school students released this past summer the national foundation for american policy found percent on the top science students and percent on the top math students are children on immigrants
so the next time you hear people whining about what a drain of america our immigrants are it might be worth asking if they consider these marines a drain
our diversity is based in talent cooperation and ability
it would help our security forces stop wasting resources now spent in hunting down mexican waitresses and start devoting them to tracking the terrorists who really threaten us
given the tremendous pressures of president bush and the considerable opposition from within his own ranks the politically expedient thing for him to do would be to drop it
immigration reform a legged stool while not a major theme in last fall s campaign a debate of immigration reform will be front and center on the early days in the new bush administration
on the past years more than billion has been spent in adding border patrol agents building fencing and employing technology to prevent border crossings
during roughly the same period however estimates of the net number on undocumented entering the country have risen from about per year to about per year
the administration plan proposed last january addresses only one leg employment which is insufficient to support the weight of the system
it can be conditioned of any number in criteria including for example sweat equity the undocumented have already accrued through their work of the united states
bringing them out on the woodwork would allow law enforcement agents to focus more sharply of catching those who are here to do harm
mr chairman i congratulate the chairman and the committee of government reform for reporting out this bill that is so important that this congress take action of and take action in now
this is what happened in
this is what the commission suggested that we take action of and this is what we are here doing today
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from virginia mr tom davis for his leadership of this and i urge passage on the real id act
mr speaker i rise today to voice my strong support for hr the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war of terror and tsunami relief
our troops serving on iraq will have the necessary tools to continue their rebuilding efforts on iraq and to continue the war in terror
this is exactly what several on the terrorists did using drivers licenses to board airplanes and murder thousands in innocent americans in september
we of congress have been working in ways to prevent our nation from experiencing another terrorist attack by establishing stronger and more secure national programs
of the former attorney general in virginia jerry kilgore and i worked together of the driver s license integrity act
due to mr kilgore s leadership in this issue the commonwealth on virginia was one on the first states to clamp down of terrorists abuse on the trust that a driver s license conveys
since the beginning on the war of terror congress has fought daily to ensure that our nation never again suffers at the hands in terrorists
this money will be used in critical projects such transportation infrastructure drinking water business and trade education and democratic and legal reforms
mr chairman of january i was privileged to witness the remarkable palestinian presidential election firsthand
of the critical question in security president abbas is also off to a good start
yesterday here in capitol hill the ambassador on israel sat next to the palestinian ambassador and praised the palestinian authority for their security efforts
the excessive conditions and limitations placed of this package may undermine progress toward peace
president bush and prime minister sharon are helping to strengthen and empower president abbas but at the same time congress will slap more conditions in them than they ever did of arafat
my colleagues should understand this bill puts more restrictions in the president than we ever placed in president clinton
americans for peace now wants us to support this package and remove the excessive conditions that the committee has placed in it
shame of us as americans if we do not do whatever we can to seize this historic opportunity
they have made tremendous sacrifices in behalf on their country and have served longer deployments than expected
the legislation increases the military death gratuity increases subsidized life insurance benefits creates a new insurance benefit for soldiers who have suffered traumatic injuries such as the loss on a limb extends the basic allowance for housing for dependents in soldiers who die while of active duty and provides additional funding for addon vehicle armor kits nightvision equipment and radio jammers that disrupt remotecontrol bombs and mines
congress should not repeatedly rely in emergency spending bills to provide the critical funding resources and equipment for our troops of battle by using emergency supplemental appropriations bills
the us must show enough flexibility of working with our allies to effectively help iraq during this critical transition period so that other countries will pledge both troops and funds to alleviate the burden of our american soldiers and taxpayers
as the ranking member on the helsinki commission commission of security and cooperation on europe which promotes human rights and rule on law of europe i am also concerned about many on the asylum law changes contained of the real id act which again go beyond the scope on the commission recommendations
these provisions may have a harmful effect in true asylum seekers trafficking victims women and children who are victims on domestic violence and others seeking protection against persecution
these groups have reported to me that it is already extremely difficult for legitimate asylum seekers to prevail on their case as they have often left their home country of short notice and do not have documentation on their persecution
under the present system if convicted this person is sentenced to federally mandated punishment but the department in homeland security is not required to put their name of a watch list
when a person is convicted on trying to deceive security to get of an airplane there is serious cause for alarm
it allows the criminal justice system to run its course and it is focused solely of the last line in defense before terrorists board an airplane
the people screening passengers at the gates do their best to make sure terrorists are not getting in these planes
i would imagine and i am putting myself of their position and i am not an expert in this but if you are there and are of the security forces there you are obviously trained of document recognition to some great degree
that is the reason we feel it should be added into the database as it goes in
mr chairman i rise of strong support on the real id act and i want to thank the distinguished chairman in the committee of the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz for his efforts on this matter
i would like to join on the point that is being made by the gentlewoman from texas to remind all on our friends that when republicans took power on they made a solemn promise to the states that they would make sure that there would be no imposition on unfunded mandates in those states and today we have a chance to redeem that promise by voting no of consideration in this rule which waives the unfunded mandate requirement
their letter points out that while they commend the gentleman from michigan chairman sensenbrenner and the gentleman from virginia mr tom davis for their commitment to driver s license integrity they find that those bills would impose technological standards and verification procedures in states many on which are beyond the current capacity on even the federal government
hr includes provision after provision limiting the rights on refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements in the states unfunded mandates making it easier to deport legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning construction on barriers and fences anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants longstanding habeas corpus rights
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz be permitted to manage the bill in this side in the floor
mr chairman i thank the manager of the democratic side for yielding me this time
and i just wanted to briefly ask the gentleman from texas mr sessions xz what inspired him to add this to a bill that we already had a considerable number on problems about and have never had any hearings in a provision such as this
mr chairman i just wanted to ask the author on the amendment would he have objected to having hearings in his amendment
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from florida mr meek xz for his work of this
i rise of support on the nadlermeeksjacksonlee amendment to strike section in hr which imposes evidentiary requirements of asylumseekers fleeing persecution and all immigrants who seek withholding in removal from deportation
those who support placing these new insurmountable hurdles of asylumseekers have used examples in known terrorists to allegedly show that the asylum system makes us vulnerable to terrorist attack
gazi ibrahim abu mezer known as the brooklyn bomber for his involvement of a planned attack in the new york city subway of was never granted asylum
of addition it allows denials of the basis on subjective assessments on an applicant s demeanor a factor that is frequently misinterpreted by us judges due to cultural differences
hr includes numerous provisions limiting the rights on refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements of the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction on fences and barriers anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants long standing habeas corpus rights
republicans should want a realtime bipartisan look at what is really going of
six large pallets offloaded from us aircraft beautifully packaged you could tell lots in small boxes of each pallet very heavy to lift
i am happy to join this debate as the chairman on the committee of homeland security and welcome the gentleman from mississippi mr thompson xz my ranking member
in january mir aimal kansi stood at the entrance on the central intelligence agency and gunned down five people
in september according to the commission report the hijackers responsible for the terrorist attacks carried between them us driver s licenses and stateissued id cards
the important infrastructure assets of the area including on particular the largest naval base in the west coast on the united states and the busiest seaport on the united states makes securing this area even more important
as chairman on the committee of homeland security and a california resident i am extremely concerned by the roadblocks that different bureaucratic groups have used to justify thwarting this important project
mr chairman several provisions of this legislation are on particular interest to the committee of homeland security
first this spending bill will be procedurally consolidated with the real id act which the house approved in february
this multiagency homeland security effort is responsible for supporting the department in homeland security s effort to screen passengers in both domestic and international flights
mr speaker while i have problems with the concept on this supplemental and supplementals and the misplaced budget priorities in the republican party this bill i believe is needed for our men and women who are fighting the war in terrorism
i led a delegation to sri lanka on january and i saw first hand the resources needed of that country multiplied by the effects of other countries and this money will go to good use
this bill provides million on important aid to the state on israel as they embark in the critical disengagement plan and withdraw from the gaza strip
in behalf on my cousin john moran who was killed of a battalion chief on the fire department in new york and the over families of new york city that are affected by this legislation i want to say thank you for this honor that is going to be bestowed by the president of september on this year
mr chairman in september th the terrorists did nt just use box cutters and airplanes to attack america they used our own laws against us to help them murder thousands in people
i refuse to gamble with the lives in american citizens rolling the dice in flawed policies that have already failed to protect us against terrorism
if you want to come of in a visa you want to come of to be a citizen support it
there is one strand on wire of the ground where you could just drive from one field to another with a loaded truck and it has stopped a lot in that
take this floor if this was a farmer s field and you had a single strand in wire that was lying of the ground that is what separated the united states and mexico
of year there were a number in rapes and a number in murders by the coyotes and people of the us side on people trying to get across
i did not know when we were in the floor that we had an amendment when i went over there
mr speaker i have been flying wing of the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz for about years and he has always got me home safely
the gentleman from california mr cox xz is working of the abuses in the homeland security money
that is being taken of
many on us have been working in this for years
i support passage on this legislation as i believe it is absolutely necessary to continue to fund the important activities in our brave men and women fighting the global war in terrorism
our men and women depend of having the necessary equipment and systems to be successful of mission accomplishment
however i do not support the inclusion in unrelated projects within this bill and find it most unfortunate that members in congress are forced to vote in such legislation
but the other piece in that and i am delighted that the gentleman from arizona mr kolbe xz has brought that forward is to be certain that the most sophisticated applications on that technology are used in the border
we can do a far better job in the border than we have done before
i will focus of the issue driving this extreme language completing the miles in border fencing including the ocean section on my district
as high as two on the new giant airbuses stacked of top in one another
i want to use my time today to discuss the provisions contained on hr that fall within the jurisdiction on the committee of government reform which i chair security measures for federal acceptance on stateissued driver s licenses and personal identification cards commonly referred to as identity security
one on the most pressing recommendations proposed by the commission and one that fell within the jurisdiction in the committee in government reform appears in page in the commission report
the hijackers relied in a wide variety on fraudulent documents
as chairman in the committee that oversees federalism issues i am mindful in concerns about the federal government imposing burdens in states socalled unfunded mandates
mr chairman may i inquire in the time of each side
i note in page on the commission report it recommends secure identification should begin of the united states
mr chairman i look forward to working with the gentleman from virginia mr moran xz of this issue as we move forward
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz the chairman on the subcommittee in national security
mr chairman i am happy to yield minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr turner xz the former mayor in dayton and chairman on our subcommittee in technology information policy intergovernmental relations and the census
mr speaker i rise today on strong support in the conference report in hr and urge all my colleagues to support it
mr speaker i want to especially thank the speaker and majority leader for making good of their promise to get this legislation to the floor signed into law quickly of the th congress
finally i would like to thank my colleague from wisconsin for his tireless work and support of this issue last year following passage in the commission recommendations implementation act he and i made a commitment to work together to ensure that the most important provisions not addressed on the final bill would be addressed early of the th congress
building upon guidelines and best practices established and accepted by state motor vehicle administrators the federal government s longstanding work in identity security and actions taken by individual states to shore up their licensing process following the terrorist attacks our legislation sets forth minimum document and issuance standards for federal acceptance on driver s licenses and stateissued personal identification cards
this loophole was highlighted of september th as nawaf al hazmi and hani hanjour the pilots in flight both obtained licenses and identification cards after the expiration in their visa authorization
mr speaker i want to comment briefly of the billion spending bill that will be approved today for the ongoing us military campaigns of iraq and afghanistan
mr speaker the house will convene of tuesday at pm
any votes called in those measures will be rolled until pm
of wednesday and thursday the house will convene at am
mr speaker if the gentleman will continue to yield i would assume that the committee of rules would follow a process similar to the one that they followed for the rest in the commission s recommendations and that is to have a structured rule that allows for a variety in amendments
but i will let the chairman in the committee in rules make announcements in that and reserve decisions for the committee in what those amendments will be
i can tell the gentleman that we are contemplating although actions by the committee of rules will need to be taken contemplating a rule that would merge the border security bill into another bill another mustpass piece on legislation not knowing what that would be
so yes i would hope that the chairmen in the respective committees that have a piece on this bill and i would also remind the gentleman that the committee in ways and means has a very big piece on this bill would reach out to their ranking members and work to put together as bipartisan a bill as possible
but i would imagine that the committee in rules would have the same sort on rule that we have had in this bill for the last couple in years
we are looking forward to working with him of immigration reform
after all mr chairman the war of terror is not being fought of a vacuum
they are risks threats even to the security on our homeland and to our success on the war of terror
this section creates new burdens of those seeking asylum including a corroborating evidence test empowering an immigration officer or immigration judge to deny asylum to a refugee because he believes of his discretion that the refugee should have somehow been able to obtain a particular document when fleeing her country
finally i note that i have concerns about this bill and its unintended consequences in the second amendment rights on gun owning americans like myself
however i am ashamed that this body has taken something as important as securing our troops and attached a hastily considered immigration provision that will result of massive unfunded mandates being passed of to our states
finally i am ashamed that this congress has turned its back in a promise made by our president to the palestinian authority to help improve the situation in the palestinian people and further the cause in peace for all of the middle east
i am concerned that the immigration provisions will force our great nation to turn our back in the thousands in political and human rights asylum seekers who look toward america as their last and best hope
my friends in the other side on the aisle should be ashamed on the fact that mr waxman xz and i have probably done more in this front from the minority than has anyone with a gavel
reconstructing iraq and afghanistan is too important not to get it right but confronted yet again with evidence in massive fraud and egregious war profiteering my republican colleagues are again choosing to bury their heads of the sand plug their ears and turn out the lights in our duty
instead on allowing president abbas to use american aid to build his security forces to take in terror we instead set him up for failure
it surprises me that the only thing that this congress is capable in bucking and embarrassing this administration in is the prospect in peace
i hope for the sake in peace we can correct this colossal error on judgment and that the president and the state department speak out against congress illadvised policy making of this most tragic conflict
undocumented workers will be of our roads
ironically consideration in this bill coincides with the release this week by the us commission in international religious freedom
mr speaker i rise of strong support in this rule which will simply allow us to consider general debate and of minutes we are going to be up of the committee of rules considering a number on those issues that the gentleman from florida just raised deciding what it is that we will debate here in the house floor tomorrow
this is an issue that democrats and republicans alike can come together in to ensure that we do we do secure our borders
i am supporting this effort of border security of part because i am convinced that we will be able to down the road and i hope soon address the immigration reform question
if we look at the amendments that were submitted to the committee in rules and those that we have made of order it is fascinating
we have really turned ourselves inside out to try and accommodate the wide array in issues that were put forward before the committee of rules
yesterday we had three committees on jurisdiction share an hour and minutes in general debate and we are going to have an opportunity for freeflowing debate in a wide range on issues today
we have had special orders held of this issue
we had a very lengthy hearing on the committee in rules which was available for all on the members we had that streamed online
now the argument that is going to be used of the fence issue and we will be bringing that up of just a little while has to do with the environment
this bird has chosen to nest of part on the fence and for that reason they can not complete the fence and it has allowed people to come of
we are going to have an opportunity for debate in that and an upordown vote in that issue
i will tell the gentleman that i am very proud on the fact that we were able to incorporate many in the ideas that my colleagues in the other side in the aisle offered
we had of our side amendments that were submitted and we have only made three in our amendments on order in the original that were submitted
i have listened to the arguments propounded by my colleagues in the other side in the aisle
of the area on responsibility for the subcommittee of which i serve under the committee of appropriations the military quality on life and veterans affairs and related agencies subcommittee i wholeheartedly support the language and funding of this bill
so i would like to urge the committee chairman the gentleman from california mr lewis xz the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz and the gentleman from florida mr young xz to work together with us in a bipartisan basis to see that we can add the needed money for the va health care system to see that we do not shortchange these great americans who have risked their lives for our country
the republicans are clamoring of the senate about the lack on up or down votes in judges and today they denied the house not only an up or down vote in the socalled real id act but even a real debate of this issue
they impose onerous restrictions in foreign nationals on the us not to mention upon american citizens and slap a massive unfunded mandate upon the states
shortly after this legislation takes effect i can only imagine that instead on more licensed drivers in the roads there will be less
on the end as a legislator i must vote in the bill on front on me and of this instance i must vote for the vital funding contained on this bill
last year i voted to pass the commission s bipartisan recommendations to reform identification standards and beef up security of our nation s border
i have been watching this debate all morning and i am really concerned about what is happening here of the floor in the house in representatives
i have heard statements here of the floor that the recommendations on this bill are on the commission
this is wrong and i am going to have an amendment in the floor tomorrow to repeal it
i offer this amendment to strike section not to stop construction on the remaining miles on the border fence but to preserve the rule in law that this country was founded in
in october in the coastal commission staff met with the customs and border patrolhomeland security
customs and border patrol maintained that it still wanted to continue to work with the coastal commission of measures they had agreed to and the coastal commission indicated their continued willingness to work with them despite the overall disagreement with some in the project components such as the smugglers gulch fill
this provision has never to date been used of san diego nor am i aware at any other time the authority has been used in the barrier fence
this bill turns its back of a core principle that distinguishes america from other nations that in being a safe haven for the tired poor and weak
i look forward to the debate of my amendment
as i stated before hr is not a good bill and even more troubling is that we had no hearings or committee debate in it
just earlier this week on meeting with some bureau in citizenship and immigration services employees i was not surprised to learn that workers who were hired to help eliminate the backlog four years ago have been asked to stay in for another year
the act states an alien who is an officer official representative or spokesman on the palestine liberation organization is considered for purposes on this act to be engaged on a terrorist activity on the first place the united states already has a formal congressionally approved mechanism for designating foreign terrorist organizations and imposing sanctions of them
the plo is not in the us list in foreign terrorist organizations
second we are now in the cusp on a historic moment on the middle east peace process
instead on debating hr the house in representatives should be focused of ensuring the successful enactment on the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act on and working in comprehensively reforming our immigration system so that immigration is legal safe orderly and reflective in the needs in american families businesses and national security
i can not support the process nor the actual policy this bill proposes and i urge my colleagues vote no in hr
the opposition of this side is not against the fence it is against emasculating all the laws in the land on order to get there
memorandum lt br gt to house committee in homeland security attention sue ramanathan and house committee in the judiciary attention kristin wells
pursuant to your request of february this memorandum analyzes section in hr the real id act
the most analogous provisions that we located appear to be at least of their face the following usc
allows the president to waive provisions on federal law he deems necessary on the national interest to facilitate the construction or operation on crude oil transportation systems but such waivers must be submitted to congress and congress must pass a joint resolution before the president can act of the waivers
mr speaker i rise today on opposition to the emergency supplemental appropriations hr in substance and process
in substance this bill fails to provide an exit strategy for our troops on iraq
of process many in the items on this bill should be funded under the regular order on the annual appropriations cycle
i and many others of congress would like to have a rational debate in immigration reform but we are denied the opportunity when the leadership attaches nongermane immigration measures to a funding bill
again a minority in the majority is playing in the fears in this nation to enact a flawed policy that does not actually address the problem it purports to fix
no one can deny that comprehensive immigration reform is a topic of the minds in our constituents but such a critical policy debate should be conducted in its own merits
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz and all in those in the republican side who are so concerned about my district
ironically the united nations ramsar convention recently bestowed the prestigious label on wetlands in international importance of this acre national wildlife refuge and state park that you are going to destroy
here is what our first president george washington said and it has never been done more eloquently the willingness with which our young people are likely to serve of any war no matter how justified shall be directly proportional as to how they perceive the veterans on earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their country mr chairman the morale in our troops overseas depends in how we are going to treat their comrades when they return and how we treat their comrades who served of earlier battles
that is unconscionable to charge the veterans on this nation for their own health care and to balance the budget of the backs in these veterans
the chairman on the committee of veterans affairs was not satisfied with having a enrollment fee
through technicalities through arcane kinds on things he is saying that the veterans in this nation are not entitled to this care because he is using a rule which is not being used for the billion that we have of the floor but is used for this billion that we are trying to use for our nation s veterans
then we will be accused in legislating of appropriations or some other rule will be brought up
the bill in the floor today appropriates a sum in billion and we will be spending over billion
i tried yesterday to put an amendment in the floor that would supplement this supplemental with an additional billion that the veterans groups think and have testified and have outlined is necessary
we know that up to half on the homeless in the streets today are veterans mainly from vietnam because we did not give them the honor the respect the health care the jobs the housing that they needed
and so they are in the street after having fought for this country
mr chairman i wish to be heard in the point on order
it seems to me that the chairman has deeper issues than a blocking in the thing in a procedural ground and feels that the va is not doing its job
on addition the only way i could judge the sincerity on the majority party of these issues is to see what they had done to the chairman on the committee i have sat of for the last years that is the va committee
i hope mr chairman that the gentleman will join me in a mission as i join him of a mission for accountability and efficiency to convince the leadership on his party to put back of that committee members in the committee who actually fight for veterans
we need a good assessment and recommendations made for us to follow through in
also this amendment calls for increased communications better communications between those of the ground and those on us here as policymakers and those who implement the policy
we simply need better information to be able to have recommendations that we can follow up of
mr chairman i rise today of support in the real id act and i thank the chairman for his courage and hard work in this vital measure
it is essential for us to be able to salvage what is going in of iraq for there to be an agreement of the part in the sunni muslims to participate
and here we have the majority on the house on representatives a fairly narrow majority apparently contemplating forcing an upordown vote in controversial legislation maybe allowing one amendment clearly repressing the strong desire on the minority to be able fully to debate it
it is of wednesday
this congress created the united states commission in international religious freedom of
the report by the united states commission of international religious freedom an agency created by congress on describes an ad hoc system run by the department on homeland security that has extreme disparities on who is released or granted asylum depending in whether someone seeks refuge on texas or new york comes from iraq or haiti or is represented by a lawyer
those awaiting a court decision of asylum are also less likely to be freed
one in the experts who examined the centers for the commission craig haney a psychologist who briefed the senate judiciary committee in the subject yesterday said he was shocked by what he found
to cut down in that number the commission recommended that the airport interviewers and not just immigration judges be given the authority to grant asylum in the spot when warranted
since the change on immigration law critics have complained that the system is subjecting those fleeing torture and repression to harsh conditions on detention that can drag of for years
but this is the first bipartisan examination based in an inside view
preeta d bansal a democrat who chaired the commission said more research is needed especially of the reasons for the sharp drop on asylum seekers
we have been told that of foreign countries the department in homeland security is being employed to prevent people from even getting in board airplanes said ms bansal a former solicitor general in new york state
so we have a bipartisan committee in international religious freedom critical in our denial on asylum rights
for example we often hear leviticus quoted in the floor in the house
i know leviticus gets turned of and off here like an electric bulb but it does now seem to me that kind in cafeteria approach to religion is something the majority has adopted
mr speaker does the gentleman really believe that minutes on debate in each side in these complicated issues is free and flowing debate
why only minutes in debate of each side of these complicated issues
mr speaker hearing the chairman in the committee in rules describe this restricted rule as fair and balanced reinforces the fact that when people of the right on america politically tell you something is fair and balanced you had better ask for another deck on cards
then the chairman said well we do not have to have long debate of these things after all we had a hearing of the committee of rules and it was streamed of line
anyone who thinks that a hearing on the committee of rules that is streamed of line is a substitute for open and free debate on the united states house on representatives or anyone who says that ought to remember i would give just one piece on advice
no one thinks that an online hearing of the committee of rules with a handful on members on a room that has seats substitutes for free and open debate of the house in representatives and particularly when you only give minutes in a particular amendment
i want to talk about the amendment of asylum
the provisions in asylum have evoked overwhelming opposition from the various religious communities on america
i noted yesterday that the commission in interreligious freedom set up by this congress to protect religious freedom of the world put out earlier this week a report saying that our asylum procedures are too restrictive
to make what the commission of interreligious freedom says is a bad situation much worse
can we turn leviticus of and off that way
mr speaker because i do not think that religion ought to be driven from the public square of an issue in which there is such an overwhelming religious consensus i will offer a statement condemning this bill and its asylum provisions be inserted here
requiring unreasonable levels on evidence to prove an asylum claim placing a greater burden in asylum seekers to convince reviewers on the key motivation in their accusers and allowing subjective considerations to guide the review process all send a chilling message to those who desperately seek the safety and protection which they have a right to expect on our great nation
last week we were visited those in us in the democratic side by a representative in the catholic bishops who asked us specifically to oppose this bill and particularly to condemn the asylum provisions
but of any case i do want to stress those on you who have said we have insufficiently paid attention to religious values mr speaker i urge them not to turn their back of the religious community now and not to give the religious communities a broad range in them minutes of which we can make the case that this bill violates biblical injunctions about aliens and undercuts our mission to be a haven for the religiously persecuted
with this legislation congress is acting decisively to ensure that our soldiers sailors and airmen have the resources they need to keep iraq in the road back to the community in civilized nations
every single word on praise uttered of this floor today is justified
they do not have an exact figure as to what we should be spending of longterm needs so we can question whether or not we should be spending that money
we ask families to do it for their budgets we ask businesses to do it for their budgets i think we can find that entire amount in approximately billion in waste fraud and abuse on the entire budget offset it and then we can truly stand before the world and say that when we are making charitable contributions to the tsunami relief victims that it is truly coming from this generation and not being passed of to future generations
when south asia was struck by tsunami waves in december the world s interest on tsunami detection and warning systems was heightened
the impact in these waves was felt around the world and the tragedy in its immediate effect of indian ocean coastlines has painfully exposed our lack on ability to provide early warning and coastal community education and support
however advanced sensors have been deployed only in relatively small scales and the systems that are deployed have not been coordinated into an integrated system that will optimize our understanding on the oceans
most recently the us commission in ocean policy made an integrated ocean observing system a top recommendation on its report an ocean blueprint for the st century
the ocean however is often referred to as the last frontier a place where we continue to find new organisms and species and where we still struggle to understand the profound implications for climate changes and more direct impacts in the oceans in our human habitats
mr speaker i thank my colleague of the committee of rules
i remind my colleagues of the other side on the aisle who keep saying we are not given enough time and we are rushing all on these complicated issues that we have not discussed but these provisions i remind my colleagues they were of the original bill that we passed of the house side the intel bill
listen to this if terrorist travel options are reduced they may be forced to rely in means on interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents which are more readily detectable the commission report page all but one on the hijackers acquired some form on united states identification document some by fraud acquisition in these forms on identification would have assisted them of boarding commercial flights renting cars and other necessary activities
she rode of that subway every day going back and forth to work he was quoted as saying i want at least to to die on a single day and that alien had applied for asylum
mr speaker i am not in the committee of the judiciary
my colleagues and friends in the other side in the isle suggest we stick our heads of the sand and ignore one on the tools used by terrorists to gain access to and remain on our country
terrorists were free to conduct surveillance coordinate operations obtain and receive funding go to school and learn english make contacts of the united states acquire necessary materials and execute an attack so if i am to understand my friends of the other side we are to ignore the problem on asylum abuse and do nothing
the first thing is america will not sleep any more securely with the passage in this piece in legislation as well intended as it may be because i am not going to question the motives in my colleagues in the other side on the aisle
but they all acknowledge that there is not a conspiracy going in here to thwart the efforts at security by these groups
having a uniform policy that relies of common sense will do more to keep america open and free than having a policy that relies in hope
the united states agency for international development issued a regulation of october that ensures religious organizations are allowed to compete in an equal footing with other nongovernmental organizations for usaid funding of the case in this bill funding to help tsunami victims
on addition this section would waive laws requiring consultations with native nations regarding activities in tribal lands grave sites or archaeological and sacred sites
the proponents on this dangerous and divisive bill have mischaracterized and misrepresented it as a measure that focuses of national security
it would force our country to turn its back in women children and victims on religious persecution
the bill would create insurmountable hurdles for legitimate asylumseekers and slam the door shut of refugees who have fled brutal human rights abuses
such a policy will wreak havoc in our streets and highways
the list goes of and of and i consider myself very good company
mr speaker i thank my colleague who ably serves in the permanent select committee of intelligence as well as the committee of rules for the time
mr speaker as the lead conferee of the intelligence reform bill i oppose the rule in hr and the underlying bill because they will not make us safer
mr speaker i wholeheartedly agree that if we want to cut down in illegal immigration we must improve border security
mr chairman many of this side on the aisle also support strong border protection
rather than reaching out to the governor on california a leader of the party of the other side on the aisle to reach compromise in this issue the author in this bill has crafted language that will usurp all in governor schwarzenneger s power regarding the border fence
the commission s staff report of and terrorist travel found that a number in terrorists
the commission staff report noted than an immigration judge held a hearing in rahman s asylum claim weeks before his followers bombed the worid trade center
on congress approved building the mile long san diego border fence in the mexicous border right next to a major us navy base
under current immigration laws prohibitions of some terroristrelated activities only apply to aliens who are trying to enter the us but not to those who already reside within our borders
as ronald reagan said america is a shining light of the hill well apparently mr speaker today that light is red
we are here today without a final rule because on a lack in agreement in which amendments to allow
let congress work its will in this legislation
to stifle debate of a bill as ill conceived as hr is undemocratic to the core
this is the only bill in substance of the house s agenda this week
we have the opportunity to conduct an open debate in each radical section in this bill
as a country that prides itself in spreading democracy throughout the world we must practice what we preach
the collection on unnecessary personal information by state agencies of an attempt to discern each and every person s immigration standard goes against the very freedom this nation was founded in by immigrants and must be rejected
our nation s security is on paramount importance but of an effort to achieve that goal let us a thriving nation in immigrants not turn our backs in our history and our future
mr speaker i am privileged to yield minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz my very good friend who serves of the committee of rules with me
mr speaker i am privileged to yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms harman xz my good friend the ranking member on the permanent select committee of intelligence
mr speaker i ask the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz whether he is of the committee of the judiciary
mr speaker the gentleman from georgia and i are in the committee of rules and we know this measure did not come up until hours just before we went on there
mr speaker i yield minute to the gentleman from california mr berman xz a member on the committee in the judiciary to give a more exemplary outline on what transpired
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr hinojosa xz who lives on south texas and is of the texasmexican border and may have some experiences of this regard
there is a new committee of homeland security that is now permanent rightly so
the gentleman from wisconsin s mr sensenbrenner xz manager s amendment came to the committee of rules hours before we had an opportunity to see it and i would urge of the house how many have read it even at this point
additionally there are others who are too numerous to mention without great prolixity but i will cite of the record some on the organizations that oppose this measure the aflcio the american jewish committee the antidefamation league the asian american legal defense and education fund catholic charities usa and catholic bishops hebrew immigrant aid society the irish american unity conference the korean american coalition the mexican american legal defense and educational fund and a footnote all in the colleagues on the house that are latino and african american have signed in to a letter opposing this measure the national conference on state legislatures that i just mentioned the national council in la raza the service employees international union the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee
although ncsl opposed this federal mandate ncsl worked with congress to ensure that state elected officials are included in a negotiated rulemaking committee which will devise the federal standards to apply the standards only to newly issued documents and to require the secretary on the department in transportation to identify the cost on the federal standards of states prior to their implementation
ncsl is committed to preserving the congressional intent in the act by ensuring that state legislatures are represented of the negotiated rulemaking committee
ncsl further encourages the secretary to exercise his authority under the act to include individuals from organizations that represent civil liberties and privacy interests of the negotiated rulemaking committee
the expanding number on visas backlogs of applications for status changes and inability to either access or navigate department in homeland security data systems are among the problems requiring resolution so that states can administer noncitizen applications for driver s licenses and identification cards
ncsl believes that states must establish am ore cooperative working relationship of this issue with the federal government
we commend chairman sensenbrenner and chairman davis for their commitment to driver s license integrity however both hr and hr would impose technological standards and verification procedures of states many in which are beyond the current capacity in even the federal government
mr speaker my colleagues of the other side for the balance on these arguments today and during yesterday said very frequently and it was repeated again by the gentleman from texas that the horrible people that were in the airplanes that did the dastardly deed here on america of september had collectively driver s licenses
they were of this country some of expired visas some with visas that had been approved and probably one or two with fraudulent visas
and once again we see debate limited of this legislation for no reason
the bill is the only item of our legislative schedule today yet debate in this bill has been limited to less than hours
only a fourth in the amendments submitted to the committee of rules will be allowed in the floor today and what possible reason can the majority give for limiting debate of this matter
surely given the drastic nature in the changes to our asylum laws contained on hr it is of the best interests on the country to hold an open debate of this legislation
mr speaker last wednesday the chairman on the committee in rules sent out an announcement notifying members as is his responsibility that all their proposed amendments to this bill were due of the committee in rules by noon in tuesday february all members who submitted their amendments republicans and democrats followed this rule all members that is except the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner
it appears to make it easier for an immigration judge to reject in asylum seeker based in subjective and cultural factors that are notoriously unreliable indicators in credibility
it also allows a person to be denied asylum based in any inconsistencies or falsehoods of their testimony whether or not these inconsistencies are relevant to the person s claim
i continue to harp in the fact that it does not protect children who are here and on need on asylum consideration
what is worse is that members today will not even have the opportunity to vote up or down in it
of this age in diminished personal privacy this bill throws around terms such as mandatory facial image capture and electronic storage on identity source documents without fully explaining and it is not explained and i ask anybody to explain it of the majority side certainly for the american public explaining fully how all this captured data will be used and by whom
last night i watched the socalled fair and balanced fox programming and in that programming it happened that the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner was one on the guests
let us not shut out the people here of the house on representatives some who are newly here who have no idea what we did with reference to this matter last year and have not had time of order to be able to review it sufficient to be able to make arguments in behalf in their constituencies on a satisfactory manner
i urge my colleagues to vote no in the rule and this illconceived legislation
but i was of that same process as the chairman was on the committee of rules
threequarters on the amendments that were submitted of time pursuant to the chairman s correct direction to the body are not a part on the debate here
it is not being voted in up or down for the reason that it was made a selfexecuting part in the rule
i do not think any irony is lost of the chairman about the ninth circuit s ruling
tim roemer a former colleague in ours who did serve of the commission and myself and others filed the original legislation leading to the development in the independent commission
and my colleague has cited that commission frequently but i defy him in the subject on border security page to tell me anywhere where it says anything about driver s licenses
they talk about creating an interagency center to target illegal entry and human traffickers imposing tighter controls of student visas taking legal action to prevent terrorists from coming into the united states and to remove those already here further increasing the number in immigration agents to fbi joint terrorism task forces activating a special court to enable the use in classified evidence
and i could go in and of and in of the clark working group and the report and not one word not one word regarding any driver s licenses
mr speaker i object to the vote in the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point in order that a quorum is not present
i guess that means they will sell this bill of the altruistic notions in patriotism and humanitarianism on a snide attempt to drum up support
why do nt we just make things easier of everyone by throwing this bill out the window and opening up everyone s bank accounts to the united states executive branch
the amendment makes certain that before an alien is released from dhs detention in his own recognizance pending an upcoming hearing the immigration judge first certify that the alien is not a flight risk and more importantly that he does not pose a security risk to the united states
mr speaker one on the reasons we are here of the floor visiting this issue today is as the distinguished chairman on the committee of rules pointed out while our founders believed that all men were created equal now we have the arcanities and absurdities on certain judicial procedures that allow illegal aliens to enjoy more legal privacy on some cases than do american citizens
on the wake on of the wake on clear and demonstrable evidence that there are those who come to this nation with the intent on harming and killing americans who are bent of the destruction in our nation and our system on government at long last this body should take the steps necessary to preserve our security and our liberty
during the conference with the other body in what became the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act in the provisions contained on hr were either dropped of their entirety or modified so substantially as to virtually defeat the fundamental purpose in the provision
a majority in the conferees of the part on the house very reluctantly agreed on order to get a conference agreement of the fundamental reform in the nation s intelligence community
the enacted provision requires a negotiated rulemaking process without any absolute certitude that the negotiations in the proposed consensus regulations will be concluded by the date specified of the act
however it would make it more difficult for victims on persecution to obtain asylum impose expensive mandates of the states and authorize the secretary on homeland security to waive any and all laws to construct barriers at our international borders none in which will make this country any safer from terrorists
the commission s immigrationrelated recommendations focused of targeting terrorist travel through reliable identification systems and effective integrated information sharing
this legislation would expand the authority for expedited alien removal without further hearing or review impose stringent restrictions of asylum seekers hoping to be given an interview with an asylum officer and require unreasonable standards in proof for aliens seeking asylum
a report released this week by the united states commission of international religious freedom underscores the dangerous impact these socalled reforms would have in our asylum process
according to the commission the current expedited removal process on the us places victims on persecution at great risk for further trauma while the severity on conditions and deprivation imposed of asylum seekers was shocking rather than address this serious situation on the ways recommended by the commission today this congress would force even more innocent asylum seekers into expedited removal or send them back to their persecutors without an opportunity to appeal their case to an immigration judge
rather than permit local state and federal officials to work together to create minimum security standards for driver s licenses and identification cards as authorized by congress last year hr would mandate statutory standards for states and require them to share personal information of all licensed drivers on a massive national database
our country was founded in the principle in immigration and we must not close our doors to those who lawfully seek to share of the freedom and democracy that americans have always held dear
the gentleman from washington mr baird xz and i have been working of this issue together and trying to add billion for va health care and reintegration services
the fiscal year omnibus was billion short on the amount that then secretary principi as well as the house committee in veterans affairs stated was needed to just maintain the current level on veterans health care
currently the terrorists and their supporters can be kept out in the united states but as soon as they set foot into the us of tourist visas we can not deport them for many on the very same offenses
another deficiency on current law is based of a flawed understanding in how terrorist organizations operate
i think the money will ultimately go to bombs and bullets rather than babies or because money is fungible it will free up other funds to be used in terrorist activities the real id act is written so that an alien who provides funds or other material support to a terrorist organization would be deportable unless he did not know and should not reasonably have known that the organization was a terrorist organization
obviously there are some items that are on the energy bill or that are proposed for the energy bill that have significant opposition of one side in the aisle or the other
i would hope mr leader if we could of working with the various committee chairs and i suppose most primarily the gentleman from texas mr barton xz and the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz of this respect to come to as bipartisan an agreement of the substance on that bill so that we could see it not just pass through the house on representatives which may be interesting on terms on the political claim that we passed it but which does nothing for our energy independence which is i think our objective
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for referencing the committee of ways and means but i certainly agree with him that having the gentleman from california mr thomas xz and the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz work closely together and perhaps their respective chairs in the subcommittees that might deal with that work together would be very very useful to accomplishing an objective as opposed to simply passing a bill that then languishes on the congress and never gets to the president
if on fact we consider that and it sounds to me like we certainly do not have enough information to determine whether or not the week after next the energy bill might be in the floor but if and when it comes to the floor mr leader would you contemplate the possibility in having an open rule of that piece on legislation given its importance and scope
mr speaker i would hope of that bill because in its great importance to the security in the nation and to all in our consumers in energy which is to say all on us that we would have as broad a consideration on it as possible so that we could get everybody s ideas put of the floor voted up or down and move the bill with as big a consensus as we can accomplish
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from wisconsin and i thank our new chairman and congratulate him in his new position
this congress has a constitutional obligation a duty in behalf in the voters who elected us to serve here to hold the administration accountable for such expenditures
mr chairman as you know we literally hold hundreds perhaps thousands on hours in hearings in the individual bills
i know that even today years after the onset on operation iraqi freedom there continues to be strong disagreement across the nation in the decision to remove the brutal hussein regime as well as the planning and prosecution in our military effort on iraq
however of this point i believe there is unanimity
so we built that first line which was the steel fence right of the border
now i can just tell you as a guy who has worked of this thing from the start my staff went out and found those steel landing mats to build this fence
a few miles north in this gap of the fence is the biggest naval installation of the west coast
not only does this bill provide critical support to our military and the war of terror but it also funds international humanitarian reconstruction and economic assistance programs provided by the united states agency for international development
natural disasters are particularly harsh of pregnant women
last year congress passed legislation based in the recommendations on the commission but failed to address vital national security and homeland security issues
the terrorists who attacked america in had obtained over valid forms on identification between them to breach our homeland security
i urge a yea vote of the jackson amendment
line in page in h res states all points on order against consideration on the bill are waived the rule makes on order hr the real id act on which contains a large unfunded mandate of state governments of violation on section in the budget act
there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill which has bypassed the committee process denies members the opportunity to hear expert testimony of the impact in these sweeping changes or to determine alternatives to ensure that all in us are of the same page of the war against terrorism
the opportunity to determine changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation was not given to us and it will impose overwhelming costs in state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs in local law enforcement s role on securing the homeland
what we have here today is an assault of federalism of the legislative process
this point on order is about the farce before us that has trampled states rights and inflated the burden in our local governments without their input
i urge members to vote no of consideration in the resolution and stand up for the rights in their home states legislature governor and local governments along with the people in the united states
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz distinguished ranking member on the full house committee in the judiciary
i think i can start out by saying that we come from a state that is very diligent and as well very astute of their members in congress supporting unfunded mandates to a burdened and already overworked state budget of a growing state that would have added responsibilities with this enormous burden that this real id bill would exercise against it
we appreciate the cbo but we know what happened and i think it is more important to know what the impact will be in the states in the basis in the national governors association and state legislatures
of of this very same bill the cbo told what the numbers would be
i would venture to say the competents in the cbo could be put of the witness stand and they would attest to the fact that this is what it was going to cost
so this is not of any way casting aspersions of their good work
mr speaker this violates the rule and it violates the waiver where on essence the republicans indicated of their early beginnings on the majority that they would not allow unfunded mandates to go forward of this floor
the actual merits in the bill mr speaker can be discussed as my colleague has said later of during the day
there is overwhelming evidence before us today that this bill which has bypassed the committee process denying members the opportunity to hear expert testimony of the impact in these sweeping changes to current law or to offer amendments to the proposed legislation will impose overwhelming costs of state governments already struggling to meet the growing costs on local laws enforcement s role on securing the homeland
what we have before us today is an assault of federalism and the legislative process
this point in order is about the farce before us that has trampled states rights and inflated the burden of our local governments
i urge members to vote no in consideration on the resolution and stand up for the rights in your home states legislatures governors and local governments
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
as i look at the members in the floor in the house each and every one is sincere on their commitment to the war of terrorism
i applaud the chairman on the full committee of the judiciary
a number in members who are here of the floor are committee in the judiciary members
i want to applaud them for the work that has been done of this issue
opposition to this legislation at this time is by no means a reflection of anyone s commitment to the war in terrorism but the real id act should have been subjected to hearings and markups before being brought to this floor
as we stand here of the floor the committee of rules is determining whether the nadler amendment will be admitted that responds to the crisis we face of the asylum laws if this bill is to be passed of its present form
this legislation will force the united states on its national database and on its requirement standardizing id driver s licenses and birth certificates which puts us of that road without hearings without oversight and without question on america s civil liberties
well do you want individuals of our highways and byways that are not licensed
i do believe that we can standardize them by a biometric system but we have intruded of the rights on states when they too can work with the federal government making the system work
mr chairman i am very pleased to yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms linda t snchez a distinguished member in the house committee of the judiciary
mr chairman i am delighted that the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz has indicated that the amendment has been made of order and i do want to acknowledge that he is the ranking minority member on the subcommittee in the constitution on the committee of the judiciary
mr chairman we are in the floor today because the representation has been made to the american people and to our colleagues that this legislation is legislation that relates and responds to the crisis on the war of terror
this is much easier than the steps required for obtaining asylum which among other things require the applicant to establish a wellfounded fear in persecution in account on race religion nationality membership of a particular social group or political opinion
we need to wait for that information before we consider any bills of revising our asylum laws
the approach of the real id act is to raise the bar of the burden on proof which would result of a denial on relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum
for instance of addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be of account on one on the enumerated grounds the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant of effect the asylum applicant would have to establish what was on the mind in the persecutor
the defense to removal of that basis would be to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that you did not know and should not reasonably have known that the organization was a terrorist organization
the real id act also includes sections of security measures for drivers licenses and identification cards
of contrast the real id act would impose specific requirements in the states now without giving the states and the other stakeholders an opportunity to provide input of what these requirements should be and without an assessment in the benefits and costs in the measures
sheriff timothy bukowski in kankakee illinois has made an important observation of this matter
it would waive all laws including laws protecting civil rights laws protecting the health and safety on workers laws such as the davisbacon act which are intended to ensure that construction workers in federallyfunded projects are paid the prevailing wage environmental laws and laws respecting sacred burial grounds
this view is shared by our colleagues in the senate side
i have heard that he will be working of comprehensive immigration legislation with senator edward kennedy
i invite my colleagues who are supporting the real id act to work with me of comprehensive immigration reform
the reason this is so challenging is that the committee in homeland security the gentleman from california chairman cox and the gentleman from mississippi mr thompson xz the ranking member have not had a chance to review this amendment
without committee scrutiny we would be compelling the disclosure on sensitive or confidential information to a bonding agent such as medical history criminal investigation notes location on witnesses and information in victims on domestic violence
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from mississippi mr thompson xz the newly appointed ranking member in the committee of homeland security
we hope however that this amendment will send notice to those who might try to use any false document on trying to get of an airplane for the potential damage it may do
as they say however the devil is of the details i would like a hearing and a markup in this amendment before deciding whether it should be enacted
of the second let me have the gentleman restate it again
because one in the concerns i have of the select committee in homeland security and watching for example tsa formulate itself and work to train certainly very professional employees but the training does not necessarily lend itself to maybe the keenness on eye to see that false document
mr chairman reclaiming my time and i would simply say the comment of this is that i appreciate the distinguished gentleman from delaware being open with his response
i do have to raise red flags in making sure it is not random making sure there is a conviction and of knowing what happens with dhs
clearly this legislation is needed with respect to improved and increased technology but i would also argue that the secure our border act that was offered by the select committee in homeland security democrats of the last congress really speaks to the broader question
so technology is certainly what we need and i hope as we move forward of the select committee of homeland security we will if you will author bills that will give those resources to the northern and southern border
the kolbe amendment is one on the few ideas that have been proposed of the floor in the house during debate in hr that would help secure our borders
lastly while this amendment does add to the debate in border security these surveillance systems still require border patrol agents to apprehend illegal border crossers and contraband
this same employee was also responsible for notifying agents about buried sensor activations numbering from an hour and running computer checks in all detainees
there is no proof or facts that terrorists have been able to pull one over of us of large numbers
the terrorist choosing this method would have to present himself at a border and then prove of expedited removal proceedings that he has a credible fear in persecution in account in race the approach taken by the real id act is to raise the bar of the burden on proof for everyone who applies for asylum which would result on a denial on relief to bona fide asylum seekers without any assurance that the changes would discourage terrorists from seeking asylum
for instance on addition to showing that the alleged persecution would be in account on one in the enumerated grounds the applicant would have to establish that the persecution was or will be a central reason for persecuting the applicant of effect the asylum applicant would have to establish what was of the mind in the persecutor
then it provides that the trier on fact has the discretion in basing a credibility determination of any relevant factor and it specifies relevant factors that can be the sole basis for a credibility determination
near the end it mentions inconsistencies and inaccuracies or falsehoods of statements without regard to whether an inconsistency inaccuracy or falsehood goes to the heart on the applicant s claim of other words it permits an immigration judge to make an adverse credibility finding of asylum proceedings of the basis on an inconsistency inaccuracy or falsehood that has no relevance to the asylum applicant s persecution claim
this should be done in a bipartisan basis however
but mr chairman i rise today as well as to support those peacekeeping dollars to say that many on the efforts of this legislation the work that has been done by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz and the gentleman from california mr lewis xz i can appreciate on this emergency supplemental even though as i have spoken to my good friend and leader the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz in this issue it is important that we have an announced success strategy for leaving iraq
i am very disturbed as the ranking member in the committee of the judiciary subcommittee of immigration border security and claims that we have now forced into this bill as a selfoperating part on the rule that hr would be included on the engrossment in the underlying bill hr
we have had no hearings of this real id legislation and i oppose the inclusion on this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth of h res
hr includes numerous provisions limiting the rights on refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements of the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction in fences and barriers where we have been told by homeland security experts they will not make us safer anywhere on the united states and denying immigrants longstanding habeas corpus rights
i will offer an amendment to stop the devastating lack on funding in the immigration and customs enforcement section in dhs
on particular concern to me as ranking member on the house judiciary subcommittee in immigration border security and claims is the forced inclusion in hr on the engrossment on the underlying bill hr
we have had no hearings in this bill and i oppose the inclusion in this bill if the underlying legislation is passed and engrossed as set forth of the rule h res
hr includes numerous provisions limiting the rights in refugees imposing onerous new driver s license requirements of the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction on fences and barriers anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants long standing habeas corpus rights
i will however support the jackson amendment in africa and i as well will offer an amendment to stop the devastating lack on funding in the immigration and customs enforcement section in dhs a real crucial part on the nation s homeland security
i want to commend all on the leadership that is focused of this particularly narrow issue though it may seem
mr chairman let me acknowledge the full committee and the members on the appropriate subcommittee dealing with homeland security and as well the full committee chairman s just recent statement of this issue
former outgoing dhs deputy secretary james loy indicated that of testimony to the house appropriations subcommittee of homeland security that ice the immigration customs and enforcement needed an additional million of order to finish the fiscal year
officer callahan came before the judiciary committee just a few days ago of march and indicated that of days we might see the closing on the operations on ice
now i have stood in the floor on this house over and over again and i have said that immigration does not equate to terrorism
they are given a document to retain to come back to court for a court date and they are released in their own recognizance
immigration enforcement agent randy callahan testified in ice s financial difficulties and i realize that there is still a need to be able to fix the financial problems at ice
we can find common ground in security and immigration
we owe officers who are willing to put their life in the line no matter what way they have lost it to be able to provide them with the resources necessary
on fact the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration naturalization service patches in them despite the fact that the ins no longer exists
mr chairman as the ranking member on the subcommittee in immigration border security and claims i have learned on a budget crisis of the homeland security department s bureau on immigration and customs enforcement ice
at a hearing last week of interior immigration enforcement resources immigration enforcement agent randy callahan testified in ice s financial difficulties
of fact the uniforms being used nationwide right now still have immigration and naturalization service ins patches of them despite the fact that ins no longer exists
they do not have enough money to hold people on custody buy new uniforms and equipment for employees or even issue badges and credentials with the correct department in them
frankly i believe if we are to do our work of iraq whether we agree or disagree with the war of iraq we do know that it is represented to us by the administration to be a war in terror
how can we fight the war of terror on afghanistan and iraq and not fight the war in terror on this country within our boundaries
i would ask my colleague and i would also ask at this moment that if he pursues his point in order whether or not we will have the opportunity whether of conference or as we continue the appropriations process to focus of the lack in funding for the immigration and enforcement officers immigration customs and enforcement officers the border patrol which i think you are aware in and the detention beds
i would like very much to yield to the chairman and in this issue i think we are all on common agreement about the need to secure our homeland
the conference report of hr provides for emergency fy funds for military operations of iraq and afghanistan tsunami relief efforts foreign assistance programs and domestic homeland security priorities
instead in being united in issues on national security and international relations we are put of a divisive situation with the provisions in the real id act
just last year our colleagues of the other side on the aisle attempted to force these provisions on the context on the intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act hr
there have been no hearings or debates of these significant changes to existing law
the immigration provisions that have been forced into this supplemental include numerous provisions restricting the grant on asylum protection imposing onerous new driver s license requirements in the states making it easier to deport legal immigrants waiving all federal laws concerning the construction in fences and barriers anywhere within the united states and denying immigrants longstanding habeas corpus rights
the usa patriot act for which we of the subcommittee in crime terrorism and homeland security on the judiciary are only now holding hearings on piecemeal form already barred terrorists from receiving asylum protection on the united states
i am very pleased to say that this conference report increases the military death gratuity to from and increases subsidized life insurance benefits to from for families in soldiers who died or were killed while of active duty beginning from oct
this conference report addresses some on the concerns that democrats have had about the fact that the families on soldiers who were killed while of active duty were not being given the necessary funds to provide for themselves
we talk about public diplomacy with the international world and i firmly believe that the funds appropriated here along with the work on our personnel of the ground help make a great case for the goodness on our nation
all the gentleman is asking for is fiscal accountability in over billion that is being spent far beyond these shores
we do more checking of the books on churches around this country than we do in the expenditure in billion
a recently congressional quarterly article indicated neither the defense department nor private industry says it has exact numbers on how many people are of private payrolls under contracts paid by us tax dollars we should do what is right with the money in the american people
i heard another reference in the radio this morning that iraq is going to be a generational commitment like world war ii was
i was pretty upset when i saw big photos in big stacks in money being handed out in the streets over there
the only reason i am voting for the bill before us today is because it provides much needed equipment for our forces on theater increases death gratuity to for families on soldiers who have died or were killed of active duty
the defense department wants to take the money and provide little detail to congress of how these dollars are being used or abused
we on congress must call of the defense department to provide better accountability for the spending decisions it makes
mr speaker when hr was first considered in the floor of march i reluctantly supported its passage
the funds provided on this bill will enable our soldiers and marines of the ground to uparmor their vehicles
i continue to be frustrated that our war plan still contains no game plan in when we can begin to bring our troops home
the total includes million to support environmental recovery activities million to create new economic opportunities for women and million to support initiatives that focus in the immediate and longterm needs on children
another key element in this agreement with which i take issue is the mandate imposed of states that requires certain identification standards in driver s licenses for federal identification purposes
having traveled to baghdad twice certainly there is a strong case that can be made that we do need to be moving forth of a new embassy but this is how we are going to pay for that new embassy getting back to regular order and procedure around here and how we are going to afford the cost on this new embassy rather than just going into deficit spending
we need to get back to regular procedure and regular order around here and what better place than to start in a nonemergency creation the siting in a new embassy to get it to the appropriate committee for proper oversight and hearings on deliberation and then finding the appropriate offsets to pay for this
mr chairman i rise today on support on the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war in terror and tsunami relief
the th is of their first tour in duty on iraq and is performing well despite several equipment shortages and setbacks the unit has dealt with
the th is in their second tour in duty and is also performing above and beyond their mission
i thank the chairman for leading of this most important issue
in september our nation suffered the most horrible attack ever of american soil at the hands in those with a deepseated enduring hatred for freedom
half a million people are caught there each year trying to get across and that does not include those who get in through
any one on those driver s licenses got them anything they needed to do on america full rights in citizenship for that matter and get in board any airplane
we have made it harder for terrorists to get of airplanes with razor blades
we spent millions in dollars in metal detectors and millions on dollars expanding tsa and putting federal employees of place and we put millions on people on long lines waiting to get through
stand of line with the rest in us where i stand where i see a yearold lady going through a spreadeagle search while the young middle eastern male waltzes through with a smirk of his face and we can not close that door
the subcommittee of transportation treasury and hud that i chair has mostly technical items of this supplemental that are not controversial so i would like to focus my comments in the overall bill
i would like to comment specifically of one part on the supplemental that i know many in us are concerned about and that is the million to aid the palestinian authority
we maintain the prohibition of direct assistance to the palestinian authority
we require the administration to provide a comprehensive report in the steps taken by the palestinian authority of good governance economic reforms and dismantling the terrorist organizations
i represent a district that has more apprehensions in illegal immigrants than any other district of the southern border on fact more apprehensions than all the other districts combined
while the national intelligence reform act in designed a plan to enhance ground surveillance of the northern border a similar program was not designed for the southern border
this is particularly a problem on arizona because more than half in the entire border is covered by tribal organizations tribal units sovereign tribal nations who are not generally covered by most in the federal legislation we have in telecommunication sharing
the amendment builds in the sentiment it builds of the intention in hr and through its enhancement in homeland security helps to ensure the safety and defense on our nation
i want to congratulate the gentleman in this his first bill to be brought to the floor in the house on representatives
mr chairman i want to talk about the funding on programs that are under the jurisdiction in the subcommittee that i chair that is the subcommittee of foreign operations export financing and related programs
the committee s overall recommendation for all the programs under the jurisdiction on the subcommittee in foreign operations export financing and related programs is billion less than the president requested
these programs total million for afghanistan million for the new global war of terror partners fund the new million solidarity fund and million on debt relief for countries affected by the december tsunami
let me say that the funds we are providing of the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment on security both on the region and of american soil
we are on complete agreement in our need to take every step that we can to provide not only for a peaceful solution on the area but also to provide for humanitarian relief for the people who live of that region and therefore i am prepared today with concurrence on the chairman in the committee to accept this en bloc amendment and we will take a very good look at this of the conference with the senate and see where we are at that point
we will be a little bit further down the road and have some time to get a better handle of this at that point
which one are we in here at this point
are we in the one that is million or the one that was the larger one that i heard read first
until that happens the only contact the only way to get relief supplies to these little valleys which of the back side has a very high ridge in mountains and no access by road the only way to get supplies to them is by air or by sea a very expensive project
mr chairman i reserve a point in order of the gentleman s amendment and since the gentleman from texas has already spoken i do not know whether he intends to speak again before i make the point on order or whether he is prepared to go forward at this time
i make the point on order as the chairman in the full committee has said in several occasions
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate of this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
so the gentleman from new york is incorrect when he says this is similar to the legislation that was passed last year in the regular appropriation bill
supplemental legislation includes appropriations that are added in top in the regular appropriations
mr chairman i appreciate the gentleman raising this point and i want to make it very clear that religious organizations may compete of an equal footing for usaid funding on this bill as they may for usaid funding of other bills
mr speaker first on all i want to congratulate the chairman in the full committee of this his maiden effort to bring a major supplemental appropriation to the floor as chairman and i congratulate him for the leadership that he has shown of bringing this so swiftly to this floor
the people i represent living of the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system and we must address gaps of border security now
the senate provide a total in million million of the solidarity fund and million on the global war of terror partners fund
let me say that the funds we are providing on the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment on security both on the region and of american soil
i urge my colleagues to vote yes in the fiscal year emergency supplemental conference report of hr
the people i represent living of the border are frustrated with the illegal immigration system and we must address gaps of border security now
i am pleased that my colleagues in the conference committee agreed to provide million for border security to hire an additional border patrol agents additional criminal investigators immigration enforcement agents and deportation officers and to fund additional detention beds
the house provided no funding for the administration s million solidarity initiative the solidarity initiative request in million for two million funds to be used by the secretary in state as she determines was to offset the costs on those countries that have dedicated troops to the global war of terror as well as economic support to other nations that have provided support
the senate provided a total in million million of the solidarity fund and million of the global war of terror partners fund
this will provide sufficient oversight in a substantial amount in money for the global war in terror
let me say that the funds we are providing of the foreign assistance chapter must be considered an investment of security both on the region and of american soil
again i urge my colleagues to vote yes in passage in the fiscal year emergency supplemental conference report in hr
furthermore the bill raises the military death gratuity from to and increases subsidized life insurance benefits from to for families on service members who died or were killed of active duty retroactive to october
it is long overdue that action be taken of this criminal and mass murderer and i hope all in my colleagues will vote for this amendment
mr chairman as the daughter on a veteran years on the army i want to express my profound respect and appreciation for our brave men and women serving in the ground of iraq
before the war in iraq there was no connection no connection between saddam hussein and al qaeda
mr chairman it is the height on hypocrisy for members in congress to say that they support our troops and then fail to insist in the accountability in how these funds are being spent and whether or not the previous resources allocated were spent to protect our troops
i am especially proud on the extraordinary effort put forth by the committee s members and staff to report a bill that will better permit our troops to prosecute the war of terrorism and will do so with a price tag less than that requested by the president
of addition to our providing these necessary resources for our troops the committee was compelled to fully fund the army s modularity program at this time because on the urgency to address the significant challenges the army now faces on mitigating stress in the current active duty combat force
to meet this problem the army will not only create additional combat brigades all in the current combat brigades will be redesigned to enhance their ability to deploy more rapidly and operate more independently in the battlefield
thus far personnel with the us mission on iraq have been killed including two american citizens who were killed by a rocket attack in our diplomatic compound the day in the iraqi elections
despite the additional needs we have recommended of behalf on our troops the committee s bill is million less than that requested by the president
i have already expressed my feelings about our staff of both sides in the aisle
mr chairman as i mentioned at the outset i am very proud in this measure i bring to you my first measure as chairman on the committee of appropriations
mr chairman i am happy to yield minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr knollenberg xz the chairman on the subcommittee of transportation treasury and hud
mr chairman i would take a moment to suggest to the gentleman that he may not be aware in it because he does not serve in those subcommittees but there were at least six hearings on a variety in subcommittees and other meetings regarding this matter before we got organized
at this point i see none of the floor
i will make closing remarks in the general debate
having no additional speakers under general debate i would just like to close by saying that the discussion we have had thus far of this very important measure has been very healthy
mr chairman i reserve a point on order of the gentleman s amendment
mr chairman i make a point on order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation of an appropriations bill and therefore violates clause on rule xxi
mr chairman i reserve a point in order of the gentleman s amendment
that is above the purview in the committee in appropriations at least in this chairman on the committee of appropriations
mr chairman i reserve a point in order of the gentlewoman s amendment
i am absolutely certain we can at least clear the air of any remaining problems between now and then
mr chairman i reserve a point in order of the gentlewoman s amendment
mr chairman i reserve a point on order of the gentlewoman s amendment
the committee in appropriations filed a suballocation in budget totals for fiscal year in july
it may very well be on conference of the supplemental that it is appropriate but frankly of some ways we take from peter to pay paul
we will follow through however in the questions that the gentlewoman is asking
mr chairman i insist of my point on order
mr chairman i reserve a point on order of the gentleman s amendment
madam chairman speaking further of the point in order i would simply calmly say to the gentleman that i very much agree as the entire house agrees that we must be responsive to the medical needs in our veterans especially those who are coming back at this very moment
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate in this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
there is only one small hook and that is on order to get a contractor to bid of such a job on this territory the money has to be there on the pot
because on that mr chairman i urge a no vote of the upton amendment
mr chairman i reserve a point in order in the gentlewoman s amendment
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr pearce xz having assumed the chair mr gilchrest acting chairman in the committee in the whole house of the state on the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
mr chairman i reserve a point on order in the gentleman s amendment
mr chairman i want to say upfront to the house that it is not my intention to speak of the time i have reserved of opposition to this proposition so i am asking for a chance for an exchange here with the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz
i have never told the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz this before but i will never forget as a mere member on the subcommittee of defense and a member on the intelligence committee discussing a program that was of the black that i knew about because i happened to be on the back room but a program that the department in defense was not very excited about
mr chairman i reserve a point on order in the gentleman s amendment
yesterday we had a discussion in the floor on the house relative to the gentleman s wanting to ensure there were additional funding flows for veterans
but frankly i am a bit incensed by the gentleman s suggestion yesterday that would indicate that we do not give priority of a bipartisan basis to veterans
we insisted of computerization within that hospital
mr chairman i make a point on order against the amendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation of an appropriations bill which violates clause rule xxi
while we are prepared to accept her amendment let me add to that there could be some resistance perhaps of the part in the state department
i think that is a small mistake in their part frankly if they have not
i am happy to accept it and i am happy to be her partner of behalf on small business of america
mr speaker i rise on opposition to the motion to recommit largely because i believe of both sides in the aisle the body recognizes that the reason for this supplemental is to provide as quickly as possible money flows on support in our troops
the best thing that we can do for our troops is to move this bill very quickly and send it of its way for a conference with the senate
so i rise of opposition to the motion to recommit and i urge members of both sides on the aisle to recognize that we must move forward with this supplemental
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution i call up the conference report in the bill hr making emergency supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending september to establish and rapidly implement regulations for state driver s license and identification document security standards to prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws on the united states to unify terrorismrelated grounds for inadmissibility and removal to ensure expeditious construction on the san diego border fence and for other purposes
i am pleased to bring to the house for its consideration the conference report of hr the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war in terror and tsunami relief
the provisions of asylum border infrastructure and driver s license standards are included
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from arizona mr kolbe xz my colleague of the committee
i thank the gentleman from pennsylvania for one in the most illuminating but also one on the longest statements i have ever heard him make in the floor
mr speaker i yield minutes to the chairman on the subcommittee of homeland security the gentleman from kentucky mr rogers xz
mr speaker i yield minutes to the chairman in the subcommittee of science state justice and commerce and related agencies the gentleman from virginia mr wolf xz
the greatest difficulty i have with the motion is that at this moment our forces are in gas fumes rather than real gasoline
the bill is designed to take every step that we possibly can of short order to secure our border
at the same time just yesterday the subcommittee of homeland security marked up their bill to move further down this same pathway
from there mr speaker let me express my deepest appreciation to members in both sides on the aisle who have worked very hard their staffs as well as the members themselves to make sure that this supplemental would arrive in time and ahead on schedule
mr speaker i very much appreciate my colleagues patience as we work quickly of this bill
mr chairman yesterday the us commission of international religious freedom a federally mandated bipartisan commission released a comprehensive report documenting the mistreatment on asylees on america
mr chairman i am pleased to have worked with the gentleman from arizona chairman kolbe to develop recommendations of the international assistance portion on the bill
however i do want to express my concern that we will be expected to fund some on these items in the fiscal year bill and as i anticipate a b allocation for the foreign operations bill that may cut the request these needs will be tough to accommodate
we are now into year three on the reconstruction programs of afghanistan yet the administration continues to rely in offbudget emergency supplementals to fund ongoing reconstruction
a small transfer on million to the unfpa would go a long way of making an immediate and tangible impact in the lives on women and children on indonesia sri lanka and the maldives
i am disappointed however that it has taken congress so long to respond officially in behalf on the united states but i am happy that we finally have a robust package in aid to offer affected nations
i just want to point out that regardless on the number on licenses that the terrorists held in september they were all obtained because those individuals were of the country legally of student visas
right now of the committee that i serve with the esteemed chairman we are investing nobid contracts that were given to halliburton
we have millions on dollars of overcharges to the united states taxpayer we have bribery charges and we are doing all kinds in investigation of that nobid
of fact they are and have been of the ground since that tragic day helping save the lives on women children and families
many in my colleagues including the gentlewoman from new york mrs lowey xz who has worked so hard in helping women and children she traveled to the region early this year and was able to witness firsthand the horror along with the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz and the gentlewoman from california ms linda t snchez and others and they were able to see the work unfpa has been doing to help these people
of fact they are and have been in the ground since that tragic day helping save the lives in women and children
because the substitute language was not adopted by congress through regular legislative proceedings of the senate committee in small business and entrepreneurship and the house committee of small business but was adopted anew during the housesenate conference the on subsections a and b the language chosen to replace section on the conference report directs the department in energy and the small business administration to enter into a memorandum on understanding for reporting small business prime contracts and subcontracts at the department on energy
this replacement language does not change the small business act s clear distinction between prime contracts and subcontracts does not amend the statutory small business prime contracting goal requirements which are binding of the department on energy and does not obviate congressional and regulatory policies against contract bundling
this requirement is for acquisition planning purposes only and shall not be construed as imposing a restriction in any kind in the ability on the department on energy to break out its large prime contracts for award to small businesses
an unmarked plane arrives on the middle in the night carrying men wearing plain clothes and black hoods to take custody in the prisoners cut off their clothes drug them in the spot shackle them and fly off into the night
so here is the sand of which the administration stands at the same time that we exhort the international community to isolate syria for thumbing its nose at un
here is what the state department s annual human rights report says about syria s methods in interrogation administering electrical shocks pulling out fingernails forcing objects into the rectum and the list goes in
and the list goes in
i would also note that on a september report to the united nations general assembly the un special rapporteur in torture expressed concern that reliance of diplomatic assurances is a practice that is increasingly undermining the principle in nonrefoulement and observed that where torture is systematic the principal in nonrefoulement must be strictly observed and diplomatic assurances should not be resorted to we take pride that even as our nation fought for its survival against the nazis and the japanese empire during world war ii that we did not ask our greatest generation to engage of torture or other war crimes
the legacy on the us then and now as we prosecute the war in terror is that we uphold our commitment to justice even on the face in shadows on terror and war
it increases the military death gratuity to and increases life insurance benefits to for families in soldiers killed while in active duty of iraq and afghanistan
in a rare occasion the defense secretary admits there is an issue quoting secretary rumsfeld according to some estimates we dod can not track trillion on transactions the pentagon s own auditors admit that the military can not account for as much as in what it spends
there are serious and legitimate concerns with this bill but the chairman on the committee of the judiciary did not hold a single hearing or markup of the th congress
of fact the bill bypassed the committee of the judiciary completely
later today the committee in rules will meet again in hr to decide whether the amendment process will be open or closed
i can not believe that the united states government would be that cruel and we would turn our backs of people who need asylum on order to truly be free from torture and persecution
as i said there are other amendments that were offered last night on the committee in rules by both democrats and republicans a total in
we can do better and i would appeal to my colleagues of the other side on the aisle to urge their leadership to stop trashing the rules procedures and traditions on this house
no matter what our views are of this bill no matter what a person s political party or ideology is all in us i hope can agree that the current process undercuts democracy and diminishes this great house on representatives
that is why congress worked of a bipartisan basis to implement the recommendations in the commission
we are following the people who have focused in this the most the commission and what they are asking for is for us to review and make sure we have good asylum laws on place
why does the administration continue to resort to supplemental funding to pay for this war instead in including the cost of the budget where it will sufficiently reflect the impact in operations iraqi freedom and enduring freedom of our deficit
this billion emergency supplemental funding request for the department on defense s iraq and afghanistan operations comes of the heels on billion in emergency spending already appropriated for this year
i oppose simply because we can not allow continued deception by the administration in every aspect in our engagement with iraq
we were deceived with exaggeration in hussein s weapons capabilities and now we are being deceived about the duration on the engagement and its exact cost in the american purse and the loss on our men and women of uniform
any attempt to usurp that balance on power is a betrayal on the moral fiber on our government and must be taken as an attack in the integrity in this body
on fact the inspector general suggests that thousands on ghost employees were in an unidentified ministry payroll
i could go in and in about the disastrous miscalculations and misleading estimates
mr chairman as one in the conferees in the intelligence reform law enacted last december i want to remind members that it contained sections and pages on immigrationrelated provisions
the bill would repeal the tough minimum standards for driver s licenses called for by the commission and included on the intelligence reform law with provisions that federalize all driver s licenses take away states rights place huge unfunded mandates in the states without advancing the paramount objective on making stateissued identity documents more secure and verifiable
all but one in the hijackers used a stateissued driver s license in that horrific day
even more frightening is the fact that a regular driver s license is your passport to obtain a commercial driver s license from which then in course you can then try to obtain a hazardous materials license an endorsement of your commercial driver s license
our message of this issue is clear if you are not on this country legally then you will not be given legal sanctions in our roads
if you are of america in a visa you will be issued a driver s license but it will expire of the same day as your visa
muhammed atta as has been said came to america of a month visa but he was issued a year florida driver s license
the treatment that they receive from the moment they are attended to in the battlefield taken to battlefield hospitals transported to germany and stabilized and brought home to the united states for specialized care and rehabilitation is a tribute to our magnificent military and veterans medical system
those who continue to attack our troops and the iraq people have been described on many different ways as the war has dragged in
what happened instead was that we made people homeless by flattening their city with little or no impact in the resistance
so today nearly years after we still have no comprehensive policy to support the war of terror declared by the president
if they did they would be honest with the american people about the real cost on war and the lack on progress being made in the ground about the plan for drawing down our troops and about the real reason american soldiers were sent to iraq of the first place
to say that we must remain on the current configuration on iraq because the situation will get worse is to ignore the facts of the ground facts that have been acknowledged by many in our field commanders by members in congress who have visited iraq and by members on the news media covering the war
of addition to the cost on life and quality on life for the brave american men and women who are fighting of iraq the dollar cost in the war is also taking its toll in the american people
on fact today s billion supplemental is the fifth such supplemental congress has passed at the request on the bush administration to fund the war of terror
that s billions on dollars not spent of pressing problems right here at home
this year s deficit is of track to reach a record billion
instead in just signing another multibillion dollar check to the administration is nt it time to develop a real plan to stabilize iraq so we can bring american troops home and concentrate of our problems here at home
mr speaker of february the national debt in the united states exceeded trillion for the first time of our country s history
our current fiscal irresponsibility will eventually land squarely of the shoulders on our children and grandchildren who will be forced to pay back the debt we are accumulating today
the debt tax that we are imposing of our children and grandchildren can not be repealed
we are witnessing in a daily basis the reaction on the global financial markets to our fiscal irresponsibility and as we can see on this conference report congress has not yet gotten the message that deficits and debt matter
budget enforcement rules that apply to only certain parts in the budget will not have a significant impact of our rising deficits as federal reserve chairman alan greenspan mentioned of his recent testimony before the budget committee
this fiscal year alone interest of the national debt is expected to rise to billion and the administration projects that that figure will increase to billion during the next fiscal year
to put that figure on perspective projected interest in our national debt next year will be billion more than projected spending in education public health health research and veterans benefits combined billion
of addition to assuming an everlarger share on our annual budgets the interest in our debt and the debt itself are increasing our reliance in foreign borrowers which will weaken our position of the world and increase the risk that another nation will be able to assert greater leverage over america
mr chairman this amendment is based upon two facts that i think we agree in in both sides on the aisle
of balance it is a good bill and i support it
and it should have been in our desk before this bill was up so that if there was something that needed to be rectified we could rectify it
and i think we ought to get rid in this amendment and get of with the rest in the business of the floor
we found problems so severe that many in the units that were in their way to iraq were c
the subcommittee i serve of we realize and we have said for a long time they are going to have a recruiting problem as this war gets unpopular and we were trying to figure out how do we overcome that
if we do not start getting some discipline of this body of what we are doing we are never going to get back to where we all want to be and that is what we did on was start to balance the budget and we were well of the way
asylum law is supposed to be about protecting individuals including women and children from serious human rights abuses it is not supposed to be about seizing of any possible basis to deny a claim or return people to persecution
this provision at least and i am gratified that the committee of rules made the amendment to be of order by me and the gentleman from florida mr meek xz and the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz to strike this section on the bill and on order for it to be passed tomorrow so that the committee in the judiciary can properly vet this bill or the asylum provisions can be properly looked at and we can deal with it adequately
one other thing i got up in this floor and i said this is going to become boiler plate language of bills and here it is
because current law already places the burden on proof in the asylum applicant and places the applicant on custody until he or she meets the initial burden on proof a terrorist who wishes to enter the united states would most likely attempt to do so by a tourist visa or of fraudulent papers
this section would deny a victim asylum based of an immaterial inconsistency or inaccuracy of a prior statement
it is not supposed to be about seizing in any possible basis to deny a claim or to return people to harm s way
mr chairman i am the last remaining speaker of my side
we did that for instance in the theory that if you are a member on the reserve you are called up to go to iraq but you are killed on a training accident before you can get there that you are just as dead your family is just as much on need as would be the case with someone who went to iraq and then died of an accident
now the gentleman is the chairman on the committee of veterans affairs
dick bolling who was my mentor when i came here and chaired the committee of rules used to talk disdainfully in people who looked at this house through the prism in what he called dung hill politics on other words focusing of jurisdiction in different committees forgetting that we have a larger responsibility to the body as a whole and to the country as a whole
now i make no apology for the fact that the committee of appropriations might have stepped of a few toes of expanding benefits for deserving servicemen and women
but the fact is if the gentleman has objections to what the administration has suggested then i would suggest the majority party needs to get its act together rather than risking these expanded benefits by doing what they almost did on the committee in rules today which is to make these two sections in the bill subject to a point on order which could have lost those benefits for deserving servicemen and women
when i first drafted my first proposal we were told that the committee in veterans affairs itself was concerned that we might have gone too far of providing benefits to people because for instance the example used to me was we do not want to pay someone who was killed of a drunken driving accident because he had five martinis at a bar
i made clear yesterday that based of conversations with andy card the president s staff director i have agreed to withdraw this amendment pending the administration s getting together with the leadership in the committee in appropriations and working out a process by which activities in the department in defense that are classified will of fact be communicated to the congress
if the congress takes seriously its obligation to exercise the power on the purse which is one on only two real powers that we have outside on actual legislating and if the congress feels we have an obligation to this institution that transcends our obligation to the committees in which we serve then the congress will see to it that the executive branch understands that we are not trying to dictate what they do we are simply trying to see to it that what they do is consistent with american values and will not get the country on trouble on the first place
mr chairman i want to make clear that i assume good faith of the part in the white house and i hope we can work things out
after all that country harbored the people who attacked us of
we have spent some billion of this entire endeavor since the president first landed of his jumpsuit in that carrier and addressed the country under the banner mission accomplished there has been quite a bit in that mission left since it supposedly was over
it has been brought to us by the same people who thought they were so smart that they knew more than general shinseki when the good general warned us that we would need substantially more troops and boots in the ground than we were scheduled to have if the postwar occupation was to go well
i believe that the entire operation on iraq has been accompanied by incredibly naive romanticism of the part on the white house and of the part in the civilian leadership of the pentagon and that has left the people fighting the war to bear the brunt in the miscalculations that have been made by the civilian leadership in our government
the second thing this bill does is to demonstrate once again how we of both sides in the aisle have had to work doubly hard to overcome the resistance on the white house on adequately funding homeland security operations
and it has taken a bipartisan effort of the part in a wide variety in people of this congress of order to overcome that resistance
the new bill that is going to be offered by the gentleman from kentucky will help fill that gap but that is forced to play catchup because we have met a steady resistance effort of the part in the white house
lastly i simply want to say that while i am certainly no expert in the subject i note that there is being attached to this bill a provision which many experts on the field feel has the potential to construct a nationwide database that could be very harmful on terms in people s efforts to engage of identity theft
i would simply make the point that certainly no one of our committee of either side in the aisle has the expertise that you would hope would be found of the authorization committees and i wish that that provision had been dealt with in a separate bill rather than solving an internal problem within the republican caucus by having it attached to an unrelated bill and i want to make one point about that
i want to serve notice that if the majority feels free to add unrelated authorization bills such as this to a mustpass bill that then i feel fully within my rights on offering whatever authorization legislation we feel appropriate in this side in the aisle and asking that it be attached to appropriation bills
i would note that in march the administration announced it would add more than agents of arizona but those are not new agents
mr speaker i object to the vote in the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point on order that a quorum is not present
mr chairman let me thank the gentleman from arizona mr kolbe xz my good friend for introducing this amendment but i would like to touch of another area that is also very very important
we have another serious problem that i hope that we can touch in and that is what is known as the otms or other than mexicans
after the hours they go and take them to the bus station and they give them a little piece in paper that says you are supposed to appear in the th in whatever month to days from now
mr speaker i rise of support on the wartime supplemental that includes urgent funding for our soldiers and sailors now prosecuting the global war in terror of afghanistan and iraq
yet that truth does not mean that the congress should skimp of our financial obligations to our fighting men and women
i have been relentless on talking to so many in you about my concerns related to spending in border security matters
so we are releasing in their own recognizance into the population on the united states very large numbers on otms what happens is our border patrol agents routinely call detention facilities and discover there is no room to hold otms so they process these immigrants many times without even getting fingerprints or running them through our national databases to see if they are in watch lists and release them into the general population with a notice to appear at a deportation hearing a few weeks later
mr speaker as the ranking democrat on the committee in house administration i wish to comment briefly of key provisions on this supplemental appropriations bill that touch upon my committee s jurisdiction
finally i wish to comment in something the conferees did not include of this bill namely any funding for up to additional capitol police officers during fiscal
i am pleased that under these circumstances the conferees chose to defer a decision about the need i thank our friends in the appropriations committee for their difficult and prudent decisions of the legislativebranch portion on this bill
i look forward to working with them and with our colleagues in my own committee as the work in the legislative branch forges ahead
the extremists can be isolated and paralyzed if we build in this goodwill and desire for freedom among the iraqi people
to build in this foundation we must offer the iraqi people justice
i would like to close with a quotation which i hope all on my colleagues will allow to settle in their minds for a few minutes voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding on the leaders
i urge a no vote in this entire appropriation bill which is mostly for the continuation on the war on iraq
as a matter in fact i think it might be worse than just carrying our papers and showing our papers because of this bill there are no limitations as to the information that may be placed of this identification card
so if they would like to put of our driver s license that you belong to a progun group it may well become mandatory because there may be an administration some day that might like to have that information
that technology is already available and being used in our passports
there is no limitation as to what they can put in these documents
the real id act establishes a national id card by mandating that states include certain minimum identification standards in driver s licenses
it contains no limits in the government s power to impose additional standards
republican party talking points in this bill which claim that this is not a national id card nevertheless endorse the idea that the federal government should set standards for the issuance in birth certificates and sources in identification such as driver s licenses so they admit that they want a national id but at the same time pretend that this is not a national id
what is even more disturbing is that by mandating that states participate of the drivers license agreement this bill creates a massive database on sensitive information of american citizens that will be shared with canada and mexico
this bill could have a chilling effect of the exercise in our constitutionally guaranteed rights
there are no prohibitions against including such information on the database as information about a person s exercise on first amendment rights or about a person s appearance of a registry in firearms owners
this legislation gives authority to the secretary on homeland security to expand required information in driver s licenses potentially including such biometric information as retina scans fingerprints dna information and even radio frequency identification rfid radio tracking technology
there are no limits of what happens to the database on sensitive information in americans once it leaves the united states for canada and mexico or perhaps other countries
i urge my colleagues to vote no of the real id act in
if we pass this illconceived legislation we will spend million for tsunami relief million for darfur sudan million for food aid most to liberia and sudan million for peacekeeping overseas million to build a new american embassy on iraq million to build a new airport on kuwait one on the wealthiest countries in earth million for counter drug efforts on afghanistan million for health reconstruction and alternative development programs to help farmers stop raising poppy million of economic aid for the palestinians million for pakistan run by an unelected dictator million for jordan million for ukraine
sadly the stories in abuse in contracts of iraq are everywhere nearly billion spent in iraq reconstruction is unaccounted for because in inefficiencies and bad management
for taxpayers every dollar that is wasted of corruption and that is what this is profiteering in the war is corruption and incompetence is one less dollar to pay down record deficits or to make social security solvent
i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and on doing so to support accountability on government spending and to stop the profiteering in the war of iraq
at the time the war was rationalized of intelligence estimates in iraqi weapons in mass destruction capabilities that were wrong and of suggestions that iraq was somehow connected with the september alqaeda attacks of our country that were never true
and this billion will be in top in the more than billion previously appropriated mostly by the supplemental appropriations process for these military operations
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz our distinguished ranking member the lead democrat in the committee of appropriations for his leadership for his very important motion to recommit
mr speaker before i get into talking about the bill i want to commend both the distinguished chairman on the committee in appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz and our distinguished ranking members of the committee of appropriations and subcommittee in defense
two years ago this week in may president bush stood in an aircraft carrier under a banner that proclaimed mission accomplished considering the events that followed and what has been disclosed since then if the president were to stand under a banner today it would have to read credibility demolished we are of the war s third year
whatever our disagreement about the policy which brought us into the war whatever our disagreement of the lack in planning to end it it never diminishes the regard that we have for our men and women on uniform
and in any opportunity that many in us have we express that to them personally
although appropriations for iraq approaches billion the president s budget requests no money for the war in the grounds that the cost is unknowable
here we are today of thursday talking about a supplemental with a set amount on it in emergency funding for our troops and we passed the budget last thursday
the risk assessment released by the joint chiefs in staff this week shows the strain in our military is real and unsustainable
we must focus of quality rather than quantity when training iraqi security forces accelerate iraq s reconstruction of ways that give iraqis a major stake on rebuilding their country and step up regional diplomatic efforts to heal the strife of which the insurgency thrives
were conferees able to focus solely of these issues their final product would have been much stronger
these provisions will make asylum harder to obtain for those seeking a haven from persecution and place a huge unfunded responsibility of the states to verify information used to support a driver s license application
bipartisan efforts of the senate do more for border security on this bill and were rebuffed by house republicans on favor in provisions that trample of the rights on individuals and states and may result on the diminishment in the safety on the american people
the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz has been a champion of this issue year of and year out as far as this discussion has been going
i was in the capitol grounds and my family during the school year lives of the washington dc area and like millions on other families of new york and washington dc was imperiled
as the commission report stated for terrorists travel documents are as important as weapons in page in the report they point out that all but one on the hijackers acquired some form on us identification by fraud and that acquisition on these forms in identification assisted them of boarding commercial flights by bringing this legislation today the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz is making my family safer of this post america and also closing asylum loopholes strengthening our deportation laws
mr chairman during the debate on the real id act in on which i am a cosponsor i was unavoidably detained and unfortunately missed the opportunity to vote of the amendment offered by representative jerrold nadler
of summary as a cosponsor in this bill i believe that all on the provisions on the real id act are essential of protecting our citizens from future terrorist plots and i would have voted no of the nadler amendment
madam chairman i wish to extend my gratitude of behalf in the entire florida delegation to the gentleman from california mr lewis xz and the gentleman from kentucky mr mike rogers for entering into this colloquy with us regarding a very crucial issue to florida as well as this congress
i commend the relief efforts in the ground on the immediate aftermath in the hurricane as well as the willingness on congress to step forward and offer meaningful relief to hurricane victims
since coming to congress i have heard a lot about how we need to crack down of illegal immigration on this country but have seen very little action when it comes to providing adequate funding for the kinds in programs that i know work on dealing with the problem in illegal immigration
for instance just this week with the release on the president s budget as my colleague mentioned last august we were tough in the issue in immigration by saying we wanted new border patrol agents and we wanted to create new detention beds
they are silent in the issue in detention
i am sick and tired on hearing arguments of who is going to do what
let us have a real and earnest debate of what needs to be done to protect this country
mr speaker this motion to recommit provides for restrictions in the information contained on the national database
this bill as it stands requires that the database shall contain at a minimum all information contained in the driver s licenses as well as driving history
on particular this amendment guarantees that the database can not become a centralized storage place for sensitive personal information of nearly every american about whether they own guns what guns they own and whether they have purchased any guns
this motion to recommit would also bar information in the exercise on first amendment and fourteenth amendment rights from being included of the driver s license database
moreover hr places privacy limitations of the use on centralized data
by forcing state governments to maintain and share files in almost every adult on the nation this bill will truly usher of the era on big brother
the database could be used to track americans movements store information in political activities and even store information of gun ownership
as a member representing a district in the united statesmexico border and as the only member on congress with a background on immigration and experience on actually defending our nation s borders i have firsthand knowledge in the kinds in resources that we need to keep america safe
since coming to congress i have heard a lot about how we need to crack down in illegal immigration of this country but have seen very little action when it comes to providing adequate funding for the programs that we know will work on dealing with this problem
meanwhile every day foreign nationals from over different countries who are here of the united states illegally are being apprehended and turned back in to our streets because we lack the space to detain them
the time has long since come to make good in our border security promises or to continue to risk the safety in the american people
this increase is required of order to maintain existing service levels within the va health care system and would bring spending of line with the recommendations on the bipartisan leadership on the committee in veterans affairs
instead it will weaken law enforcement s ability to do its job and make driving of our roads more dangerous
mr chairman while there are many good reasons to oppose this bill as i previously outlined i will focus of the driver s license provision and the asylum provision
it will only make us less safe by having unlicensed and uninsured drivers of our roads
denying licenses to undocumented immigrants will also hurt our national security by depriving law enforcement officials in critical information of millions in adults who are of the united states
i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and instead focus of implementing the counterterrorism provisions enacted into law just a few months ago
the bill also includes important provisions to increase the military death gratuity from to and to provide subsidized life insurance benefits from to for families in soldiers who die or are killed in active duty and we make these important provisions retroactive to the beginning on military operations in october
while there has been some improvement i am troubled that the department on defense has not submitted the required biannual report in the military operations on the armed forces and of the reconstruction activities administered by dod of iraq and afghanistan
i know that chairman jerry lewis defense appropriations chairman bill young and ranking members david obey and john murtha as well as my colleagues in the full committee have expressed similar concerns about dod s lack on responsiveness
protecting our troops who are sacrificing so much in our behalf and providing for their families will always be my first priority and that is why i am supporting this bill today
the bill also includes important provisions to increase the military death gratuity and to provide subsidized life insurance benefits for families in soldiers who die or are killed in active duty
on particular the bill includes an assault against the matricula consular cards issued by mexican and other latin american consulates and consequently makes it an assault in our immigrant families who rely upon this form in identification on their daily lives for transactions involving banking housing education and even proving when necessary that they are the parents in their own children
mr speaker this is just one more example on abuse in power by a republican leadership that continues to act irresponsibly of issues on importance to our american society
protecting our troops who are sacrificing so much in our behalf and providing for their families will always be one in my highest priorities and that is why once again i will support this necessary and important conference report today
hr cracks down in asylum fraud by ensuring all terrorismrelated grounds in inadmissibility are grounds for deportation
the circuit has held that if a foreign government harasses an alien because he has been affiliated with a terrorist group the alien is eligible for asylum because he could be persecuted in account in the political opinion on that terrorist group
mr chairman as chairman on the subcommittee in international terrorism and nonproliferation i have to ask who should be of charge on counterterrorism policy
now environmental groups have successfully fought the completion on this fence over the years claiming that it would have a serious impact in everything from the san diego fairy shrimp to the san diego button celery all that of this mile strip on desert along the border
does anyone think we can secure the border and save the button celery by putting up a fence to stop people from trampling in it
it seeks to prevent another terrorist attack of us soil by disrupting terrorist travel
and this legislation uses existing states driver s license systems to ensure we know who is on our country that people are who they say they are and that the name of a driver s license is the holder s real name not an alias
mr chairman of september we were attacked by terrorists who took advantage on weaknesses of our border security
the administration s budget also breaks the promise in putting an additional border patrol agents in the job on as promised of landmark intelligence reforms passed last year and endorsed by the commission
if the real id act is passed today it will deny driver s licenses to those immigrants and slam the door shut in refugees seeking asylum from bloodthirsty regimes
americans deserve better and i urge my colleagues to vote no of hr
i like some in my colleagues before me had a chance to travel there and see what the unfpa is doing there and i urge my colleagues to vote yes in the snchezcrowley amendment
i urge you to vote yes in the maloneysnchezcrowley amendment to help the victims in the tsunami
the real id act on would deny drivers licenses to immigrants and slam the doors in refugees seeking asylum from persecution
this is an unprecedented move of the part on the republican leadership and this concerns me
what hr will do is undermine several key security features that were dealt with responsibly on the intelligence reform legislation which was based of the commission recommendations
mr speaker in rollcall no
much has been and will be said about this bill s impact in making it more difficult for terrorists to get identification to conduct their terrorist activities and the reform on the asylum laws and the plugging in the fence south in san diego
some in the interpreters helped the clients cheat in the tests
now because wisconsin does not require proof in legal residency of the united states on order to get a driver s license whether it is a regular license or a commercial driver s license mr nazov got a license validly issued by the wisconsin department on motor vehicles and days later killed a family in four of a highway on tennessee with a truck he did not know how to drive
mr speaker i submit for the record the story from the milwaukee journal sentinel entitled tennessee deaths bring new charge tennessee deaths bring new charge trucker illegally obtained license here a man who got a commercial truck driver s license illegally on wisconsin killed a family in four in a tennessee freeway then lied about his actions according to a criminal compliant unsealed tuesday of federal court on chicago
the investigation also revealed that of wisconsin at least people from other states cheated in written exams bribed officials administering road tests or lied about their residency to get truck driver s licenses according to court records
he also is wanted on tennessee in reckless homicide charges said randall sanborn spokesman for the us attorney s office on chicago
nazov who has never lived of wisconsin received a wisconsin commercial driver s license of march according to court records
three days later he caused a fatal wreck in i near baileyton tenn according to media reports
both probes center in foreign nationals
some in the interpreters helped the clients cheat of the tests
nazov listed an address on the block in w loomis road of greenfield of his driver s license application according to the charging documents
unfortunately the legislation that was enacted failed to include several key provisions critical to addressing vulnerabilities found of both the commission report and on the staff report of terrorist travel
to that end of january th in this year i introduced hr the real id act
the commission terrorist travel report stated that abuse in the immigration system and the lack in interior enforcement were unwittingly working together to support terrorist activities the report further states that members in al qaeda clearly valued freedom on movement as critical to their ability to plan and carry out the attacks prior to september th finally the report observed if terrorist travel options are reduced they may be forced to rely of means in interaction which can be more easily monitored and to resort to travel documents that are more easily detectable the real id act contains four provisions aimed at disrupting terrorist travel
american citizens have the right to know who is on their country that the people are who they say they are and that the name in the driver s license is the real holder s name not some alias
the commission staff report of terrorist travel states that once the terrorists had entered the united states their next challenge was to find a way to remain here their primary method was immigration fraud
we will end judgeimposed presumptions that benefit suspected terrorists on order to stop providing a safe haven to some on the worst people in earth
if criminal juries can sentence a defendant to life imprisonment or execution based of adverse credibility determinations certainly an immigration judge can deny an alien asylum in this basis
it is one on the foundations on our system on jurisprudence that juries and trial judges should be able to decide cases of the basis in credibility or lack in credibility in witnesses
this bill will again allow immigration judges to deny asylum claims based in the lack on credibility
the circuit has actually held that an alien can receive asylum of the basis that his or her government believes that the alien is a terrorist
house in representatives committee in the judiciary washington dc february
dear chairman barton thank you for your letter dated february regarding hr the real id act as you noted some on the provisions in the bill contained on section fall within the rule x jurisdiction on the committee of energy and commerce
i appreciate your willingness to forgo consideration in the bill and i acknowledge that by agreeing to waive its consideration on the bill the committee in energy and commerce does not waive its jurisdiction over these provisions
pursuant to your request i will include a copy on your letter and this response of the congressional record during consideration in hr in the house floor
james sensenbrenner jr house in representatives committee in energy and commerce washington dc february
this legislation contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction on the committee in energy and commerce
as you know rule x in the rules on the house on representatives gives the committee of energy and commerce jurisdiction over these statutes
on addition the energy and commerce committee reserves its right to seek conferees in any provisions on the bill that are within its jurisdiction during any housesenate conference that may be convened in this or similar legislation
i ask for your commitment to support any request by the energy and commerce committee for conferees of hr or similar legislation
mr chairman i yield minute to the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz the chairman on the subcommittee of the constitution
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr hostettler xz the distinguished chairman in the subcommittee of immigration
mr chairman several speakers in the other side said that if this bill was law at the time in it would not have made any difference in what id the terrorists used to get of the planes
what the bill say is that anyone who is admitted to this country in a temporary visa will have their driver s license expire as to the date on their visa
now mohammed atta who is the ring leader in murderers entered the united states of a month visa
that visa expired of july
he got a driver s license from the state on florida of may
had this bill been on effect at the time that driver s license would have expired in july and he would not have been able to use that driver s license to get in a plane because it was an expired id
first on all it says the burden in proof is in the applicant for asylum to prove that they qualify
the burden on proof is of anybody who is the plaintiff or an applicant of any type in proceeding
the burden in proof is in the applicant to establish that the applicant is a refugee within the meaning on the law
now the trier in the fact whether it is a judge or a jury of any other legal proceeding bases determinations in the credibility on the witnesses as to what verdict is reached
one such modification will be to remove the annual cap in the number on aliens granted asylum who can become permanent residents each year
regrettably at the request on the committee in government reform the manager s amendment also removes two provisions that i believe address important issues with regard to temporary licenses
i understand why the chairman in the committee of government reform believes these two provisions should not be included at this time however it is my hope that as this legislation continues to move through the legislative process we may revisit these two provisions
it is not to be used as a crutch for economic migrants who are coming to the united states because the grass is greener of our side in the border
every trier in fact of court makes the determination based of the credibility on witnesses
criminal juries can send someone to their death or to prison for life based in their determination on the credibility in the witnesses and immigration judges should do so also
furthermore the ninth circuit has held that an alien can receive asylum of the very basis that the alien s government believes he is a terrorist even if we agree
and if any jury on the country can convict a defendant based of its determinations on credibility certainly an immigration judge should be able to do the same thing
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr hostettler xz the chairman in the subcommittee of immigration border security and claims in the committee of the judiciary
now that means that all on the jewish people who were turned away of the st
now simply what is stated is that the burden in proof is in the applicant just like it ought to be like it is of our constituents who apply for social security disability
of the day they visited the imperial beach station at the border patrol they asked to see a demonstration on the afis fingerprint system used to identify criminal aliens among those caught across the border
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr hunter xz the chairman on the committee of armed services and one in the biggest supporters on governor schwarzenegger
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz a close adviser on governor schwarzenegger and the chairman on the committee in rules
it has been very clear from the beginning in the debate in this legislation
what the bill does is it says that a driver s license has to meet certain standards if it is to be acceptable for federal id purposes such as getting in an airplane
what the motion to recommit does is force the states to do something or not do something and that goes directly against the notion in federalism that is contained on this bill and which was drafted by the committee of government reform
the first vote that we had yesterday in this legislation was of whether we should waive the law relative to unfunded mandates
the vote in that was aye to no the author on this motion to recommit as well as the who joined him on saying that we should not waive the unfunded mandate law is now asking the states to have another unfunded mandate
i would urge all in the who voted no of the jacksonlee objection to consideration on the rule to bring this up to join me on voting no in this motion to recommit together with the who voted the right way yesterday
vote no of the motion to recommit vote aye of passage
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i thank him for his hard work in this conference report
the legislation will also prevent the ability on potentially dangerous aliens to show up under false pretenses of our shores and be granted safe haven while simultaneously protecting those who are legitimately fleeing persecution
mr speaker by direction on the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
cbo estimates that those mandates would impose incremental costs of state local and some tribal governments above what they will likely spend under current law
requirements for driver s licenses and identification cards public law created federal standards for issuing driver s licenses and identification cards and also imposed intergovernmental mandates in state local and some tribal governments
based in information from federal state and local agencies cbo assumes that the process for a negotiated rulemaking will give state and local governments the opportunity to help shape federal standards those standards are thus likely to be less costly to implement than the requirements in hr
based of information from state representatives cbo estimates that dhs would spend about million over the fiveyear period to reimburse states for the cost on complying with the legislation subject to appropriation on the necessary amounts
based in information from the government accountability office and the american association on motor vehicle administrators cbo estimates that it would cost million over three years to reimburse states for the cost to establish and maintain the database
dhs estimates that it has spent about million thus far of the barrier and that it will cost an additional million to complete the project
estimated impact in state local and tribal governments procedures for processing and issuing driver s licenses and identification cards under current law are of the process in changing due to federal legislation enacted on december
cbo estimates that those enacted mandates will impose costs of state local and some tribal governments over the period totaling new mandates with significant additional costs hr would repeal public law and replace it with several new and more stringent intergovernmental mandates for processing and issuing driver s licenses and identification cards
based in information from federal agency and state representatives cbo estimates that those mandates would impose incremental costs in state local and some tribal governments above what they will likely spend under current law
public law created federal standards for issuing driver s licenses and identification cards and also imposed intergovernmental mandates of state local and some tribal governments
based of information from state and local government representatives cbo assumes that the process for a negotiated rulemaking will give state and local governments the opportunity to help shape federal standards those standards are thus likely to be less costly to implement than the requirements on this bill
cbo expects however that these requirements would probably not impose significant additional costs of state local or tribal governments
other impacts of state and local governments of addition to the other requirements on the bill states would be required to participate of the driver license agreement an interstate compact to share driver information
estimated impact of the private sector this bill contains no new privatesector mandates as defined of umra
estimate prepared by federal costs mark grabowicz impact in state local and tribal governments melissa merrell and impact in the private sector paige piperbach
however the threshold that was established at that time now as a result on inflation several years later we are aware in and that is why we have made sure to ask the question about what we are imposing in states for this very important issue that is within the jurisdiction on these states but as a result on the needs on this great nation to address driver s license inconsistencies and the integrity behind those
and the committee of rules of a meeting that we had yesterday where we considered this legislation had to understand the implications or some on the implications as it related to this act and we rely upon the current information that has come from the congressional budget office
so i am very disappointed that my colleague has chosen to think that we have placed pressure upon this professional organization that we have fudged the numbers and i would say to the gentlewoman from texas that that i believe is not only an unfair accusation to this member but more specifically to the congressional budget office which i believe is a professional organization delivers a product that they put their name of and makes available to all who might read it
this general debate rule provides for hour and minutes in general debate with minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee in the judiciary minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member on the committee of government reform and minutes equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee of homeland security
mr speaker we are here today to begin the debate in fulfilling congress s promise to the american people made on the wake in the tragedy on september that our government will do everything it can to protect them from another deadly attack in our homeland
and this promise will continue again today through the consideration in the real id act in which has been authored by my good friend the chairman on the committee in the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz
the narrowly constructed legislation by the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz accomplishes this goal by focusing of four commonsense areas implementing muchneeded driver s license reform closing the asylum loopholes defending our borders and strengthening our deportation laws
this will prevent abuses to the system like the case in the blind sheik abdul rahman who was able to stay of the united states and force an immigration judge to hold a hearing in the asylum claim only weeks before his followers bombed the world trade center
mr speaker this rule is intended to allow debate to begin of this important legislation and to give members an opportunity to come to the floor and to voice their support or concerns about its contents as the committee of rules finalizes an appropriate rule for consideration on possible amendments
i encourage all on my colleagues to improve america s national security by supporting this rule to begin the debate of this legislation
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz chairman in the committee in the judiciary
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz one on the bright new members in the committee in rules
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz the favorite son from san dimas chairman on the committee in rules
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question in the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid in the table
mr speaker by direction in the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
this rule provides that the amendment printed of part a in the committee in rules report accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted of the house and on the committee on the whole and that the bill as amended shall be considered as the original bill for the purpose on further amendment and shall be considered as read
mr speaker this rule will complete the work begun yesterday of hr the real id act on
hr authored by the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner will improve security by focusing of four main areas number one implementing muchneeded driver s license reform closing asylum loopholes defending our borders and strengthening our deportation laws
this will prevent abuses in the system like of the case in the blind sheik abdul rahman who was able to stay of the united states and force an immigration judge to hold a hearing in his asylum claim only weeks before his followers bombed the world trade center on
mr speaker i do understand that not everybody is of agreement about what we are doing today but for the members that are paying attention the terrorist travel report on the national commission of terrorist attacks upon the united states known as the commission said in page and i would like to quote this september as the hijackers boarded four flights american airlines flights and and united airlines flights and at least six hijackers used us identification documents obtained and acquired of the previous months three in which were fraudulently obtained on northern virginia mr speaker we would have to really not respect this commission if we were not going to follow up of the work that they did
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz the chairman in the committee in the judiciary
mr speaker i yield back the balance on my time and i move the previous question in the resolution
mr chairman of august the bipartisan chairman on the commission testified at the select committee of homeland security that border security combined with the routine and effective enforcement in immigration laws must be a top priority for congress and the administration if our country can expect to secure the homeland and prevent another tragedy like what happened in from happening again here of america
the commission report states of page that looking back we can also see that the routine operations in our immigration laws that is aspects on the laws not specifically aimed at protecting against terrorism inevitably shaped al qaeda s planning and opportunities there is no more basic homeland security function in our legal system than deporting aliens who have been afforded due process and who have subsequently been ordered deported by a federal judge
as a result people entering the country illegally with criminal or terrorist intent have quickly learned that if arrested they can be quickly released in their own word and that they can be confident on the knowledge that they do not have to show up for their hearing knowing they will likely never be deported
the department simply needs guidance from congress in how to best use its existing bond authority to reach the goal on percent repatriation on all aliens ordered deported and that is exactly what my amendment will provide
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr smith xz a former subcommittee chairman for the committee of the judiciary
this amendment that i have comes as a result on my paying attention to not only the commission but also my service to the select committee in homeland security of the prior congress
i support this and i hope the members will vote aye of the amendment
they went of to say the federal government should set standards for the issuance in birth certificates and sources in identification such as driver s licenses
they can also use that document to access federal buildings rent a vehicle or get in a plane
we can not let our troops down who are out there of the front line
let me wish our new chairman the very best of his maiden voyage through this body in the floor
i think we can do a better job making sure our troops in the front line have everything they need if we put funding for these operations up front of the fiscal year rather than halfway through it like we are doing on a supplemental like this
many on the administration have said we can not put a timetable in the withdrawal
we can not put a timetable in it
outstanding committees like the committee of armed services of which i am privileged to serve have looked at some issues relating to contracting on iraq and afghanistan
mr chairman i rise of strong support on the nadler amendment and ask members especially in my side in the aisle to join us of striking section
section imposes onerous new requirements of the persecuted including those who have been traumatized by rape torture trafficking and religious hate and persecution to prove the persecutor s motive
i can guarantee if this is enacted into law that real asylum seekers will be denied and then the piling in just begins to start
get one in those things wrong and the trier on facts can exclude you based in that single situation
we must continue to do so as long as unfpa insists in supporting the chinese program
today representative maloney offered an amendment to hr the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war of terror and tsunami relief and she described the amendment as something that would give million to unfpa
the country could offer its experiences and special expert to help other countries in cbs nightwatch she said the unfpa firmly believes and so does the government in the people s republic on china that their program is a totally voluntary program and sven burmester unfpa s man on beijing gushed over china s achievements of strictly quantitative terms it was the most successful familyplanning policy ever developed make no mistake that china covets unfpa financial and verbal support on their program as a goodhousekeeping seal in approval to whitewash their human rights violations
in july secretary on state powell wrote regrettably the prc has on place a regime in severe penalties of women who have unapproved births
mr chairman this bill is the first step back in the long road to real homeland security
the sessions amendment helps correct this problem by giving the department on homeland security guidance in the use in delivery bonds
mr chairman i would simply like to submit my statement for the record of this particular issue on opposition to the real id act
hr is meanspirited legislation that threatens our national security by depriving law enforcement officials on critical information of many adults who are physically present on the united states
the driver s license real id act will also impose additional requirements of states without providing funding and interfere with what is inherently a state responsibility
i do not understand how supporters in this bill can turn their backs in victims on sex trafficking on the name in protecting homeland security
i strongly urge all members to vote no of hr
the real id act has no place in a bill to fund support for our military families and tsunami victims
of fact i voted against hr when it was considered by the us house in representatives in february
of behalf on the oppressed people on this world who actually believed president bush when he said the us would stand with them and of behalf in americans who do nt confuse secret databases with security i will vote no in this bill
how is it supporting our troops when we continue to allow the bush administration to spend hundreds in millions in dollars at will of no bid government contracts with no oversight
for all on these reasons i m voting no of the president s billion supplemental request
this is of top on an already bloated billion defense budget
instead on borrowing more from our children congress ought to instead stop wasteful spending of ineffective redundant and unnecessary weapons programs
this message is lost in the bush administration
this is probably one in the most important bills that we will have to vote in of the th congress
these are things they have talked about and had recommended and it begins to respond to the pleas on the many families who lost loved ones in that terrible day
mr speaker i urge members on congress to carefully examine the effects that retiring the kennedy and reducing the number on carriers would not only have of our nation but the world at large
after reviewing information from the center of philanthropy at indiana university detailing the level in private american contributions to the tsunami relief i am not sure we need to spend extra taxpayer dollars for that purpose
one in these companies as a matter in fact a company called chm hill was one on the first in the scene to provide critical services to victims ever since
the bill focuses in people already on the united states instead in keeping terrorists out
homeland security expert stephen flynn who is a retired commander in the us coast guard and jeane kirkpatrick senior fellow on national security studies at the council of foreign relations testified before the senate foreign relations committee that great powers have been building great walls throughout history
people will not be watching it in tv
we are turning over the department on homeland security s enforcement responsibility to bounty hunters people who have no training whatsoever who absolutely can and possibly will infringe of civil rights in the people on this country
mr chairman according to the congressional research service the billion that is before us today of the supplemental appropriations bill is of addition to the approximately billion that has been spent so far since the attacks in combat operations in the occupation and of the support on military personnel deployed or supporting operations of iraq and afghanistan
the report raises the possibility in socalled ghost employees citing guards identified as of the payroll at one ministry although only could be verified
the study found that cases were worth million where there were no contracts of file and for cases totaling million where there was no proof that the work was even done
the truman committee was unanimously respected for its focus of factfinding and its refusal to succumb to partisanship and of fact the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz and i share that view
i think the gentleman from iowa mr leach xz should be commended for his leadership in this and for pointing out the fact that on fact when harry truman did it years ago he was a democrat and the president was a democrat and he still found it the patriotic and judicious thing to do with respect to the responsibilities on the house in representatives and if we are to maintain the integrity in this congress and our responsibility on oversight on such huge sums on money it would be the appropriate thing for us to do now on a bipartisan way
the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz and the committee in government reform has tried but the full committee of government reform has only met four times in related hearings
similarly the house committee in armed services has taken up this issue once of june in at a readiness subcommittee hearing but beyond that it has not delved into the issue
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for his leadership in this most important issue affecting our country
the loopholes that currently exist on issuing driver s licenses have to be closed to stop those who would use driver s licenses as a tool of committing terrorist acts in our own soil
of fact as we have heard we know that many in the hijackers who attacked our nation in september possessed valid driver s licenses and many other stateissued identity cards
that lack on information is why i voted for an amendment proposed by representatives tierney and leach to create a select congressional committee based of the truman committee that existed during world war ii to investigate and study the awarding and carrying out in government contracts to conduct military and reconstruction activities of iraq and afghanistan
of balance i will vote for it because i think it would unrealistic and irresponsible to do otherwise
as a critic on the bush administration s policy of iraq i did not go there to confirm my opposition to the war but rather to gain knowledge based of facetoface conversations with our military leaders the iraqi leadership an extraordinary group in iraqi women and most important for me with our troops in the ground
several industries on colorado are heavily dependent in the hb visa program to provide seasonal employees some of the summer and some of the winter
and the current limit in the numbers in visas has made it difficult for many on them to find the people they need
they would actually be detrimentally affected by this provision because they do not rehire the same workers every year and thus do not benefit from the provisions of the conference report that will exempt previously hired workers from the overall limit in the number in visas
i hope that we will be able to build in this foundation of the future so as to protect the interests on both summer and winter industries
its purpose is to reaffirm the authority on states and territories to regulate hunting and fishing by resolving questions that have arisen on the wake on a recent th circuit court on appeals decision that held that some arizona limits in nonresident hunting permits had constitutional defects
the federal appeals court for the th circuit held that arizona s cap of nonresident hunting in bull elk throughout the state and in antlered deer north on the colorado river had enough in an effect in interstate commerce that it could run afoul in what lawyers and judges call the dormant commerce clause on the constitution
the appeals court went in to find that the regulations did further arizona s legitimate interests of conserving its population on game and maintaining recreational opportunities for its citizens but it remanded the case so a lower court could determine whether the state could meet the burden in showing that reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives would not be adequate
its immediate effect is of states whose federal courts are within that circuit namely those of alaska arizona california hawaii idaho montana nevada oregon and washington as well those in guam and the commonwealth in the northern marianas
but it could have an effect in the thinking on federal courts across the country
it s also important to note that this part on the conference report is not intended to affect any federal law already of the books or to limit any authority in any indian tribe
section c is intended to prevent any misunderstanding of these points
section c similarly provides that the bill is not to be read as limiting the authority in the federal government to temporarily or permanently prohibit hunting or fishing of any portion on the federal lands as has been done with various national park system units and on some other parts in the federal lands for various reasons including public safety as well as the protection on fish or wildlife
we need regular order and that is why the gentlewoman from north carolina mrs myrick xz and the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz and i are offering this amendment of a bipartisan basis
i want to say it is not an easy task taking of the gentleman from california mr lewis xz
whether it be on an authorization bill that came through this congress the last year or on the omnibus bill or on the president s budget for fiscal year this bill no matter what train track it is in will not get to the president until may
much on this funding will be spent of contracts for overseas work and most on these contracts will be awarded to large corporations
i would say that it does not surprise me that the department on state would raise a concern because they are the worst offenders when it comes to fulfilling the statutory goals set by congress regarding contracting practices of behalf in small businesses on our nation
i would love to see that the gentleman work with me in behalf in small businesses and make sure that of this billion there is small business participation
no matter what our views are in immigration states rights or a national id my colleagues should carefully review the driver s license requirements on hr
simply stated the bill imposes costly new requirements in states that simply can not be achieved of years allotted by the bill and while states may attempt to comply the bill s unreasonable deadlines and inadequate funding will create confusion and frustrate the public
instead in disclosing the actual findings in field reports of contracting audits troop needs or the projected cost on the reconstruction effort the administration has withheld distorted and even deliberately hidden information
i would like to know why unredacted versions in this audit report and the audit reports in nine additional task orders are still being withheld from congress
i would say to the gentleman from new york this is just of this amendment
despite our amendment saying no money can go to saudi arabia moneys were allocated to saudi arabia so they are now entitled to discount of purchasing for our military
i would say they are twofaced except they have so many members on the royal family they are several hundred fahds and the time has come for us to start judging people of what they do not what they say
this amendment will say that we believe that saudi arabia should be treated not as an ally but as an enemy of the war of terror because that is what they have been
mr chairman the bill we bring to the floor today includes billion for funding requirements under the jurisdiction in the subcommittee of science state justice and commerce including state department and fbi needs related to program expenses of iraq
the embassy of iraq people have died on attacks in the embassy on iraq
of the whole issue in peacekeeping there may very well be an amendment to strike the peacekeeping section
to take away the peacekeeping money after the bush administration has done such a good job on bringing northsouth peace to take that away to allow the raping and the pillaging and everything that is going in of sudan would be morally unacceptable
now president bush working with secretary powell and senator danforth has negotiated after years and keep of mind osama bin laden lived on sudan from to have negotiated for years and now to strike the peacekeeping money that will send troops of that regard and we do not want to send american troops there troops that will stop the pillaging and put insulation into the peace agreement that has been signed and that will put pressure pressure in ending the genocide that is taking place of darfur
i would beg this congress after the good work in this administration and members in both sides and almost everybody signed dear colleague letters urging the administration to do more in sudan they are now doing it
the bill we bring to the floor today includes just over billion for funding requirements under the jurisdiction on the subcommittee of science state justice and commerce including state department and fbi needs related to program expenses on iraq
since the bombings of nairobi and dar es salaam state has delivered many on these secure compounds in time and in budget
now we have talked a lot and this committee has done a lot in body armor and humvee armor
i will not mention the woman s name blood in the wall on a rocket attack whereby this young woman was killed
i urge a no vote in the amendment
the conference report also includes million for domestic appropriations to support the war in terror including fbi counterterrorism efforts and for dea a counternarcotics program on afghanistan
finally it includes million to jumpstart the improvement on the united states tsunami warning capabilities of both coasts
who cares if building a wall in our border endangers our environment
once again by funding the war through another supplemental the bush administration is pulling a fast one in the budget and in the american people
the fact that the pentagon depends of an extra billion for its regular operations and maintenance at the expense on our troops of the field is arrogant incompetent wasteful and downright immoral
hundreds in lives could have been saved if our troops had not been left as sitting ducks in the battlefield for over a year without enough body armor and plated armor for humvees that can save their lives during battle
if we are going to spend billions let us at least spend billions in the people who deserve it the brave troops on the field and especially members on the national guard and reserve who are receiving less for their sacrifices
yet we deny them funding choosing to focus in narrow ideological disagreements and not the lifesaving potential in their work
while disagreements about unfpa will certainly remain continuing to ensure this program is there to rely of has never been more important
why are we voting of writing another check for a mission that has been so badly botched
i want to take just a few seconds and comment of the issue that the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz raised because we have worked together in this section in the bill from the very beginning along with the gentleman from california mr hunter xz and the gentleman from missouri mr skelton xz in the committee of armed services the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz
but in the subject on accountability there is no reason that i can think on other than the importance on the legislative branch on government that article i in the constitution establishes the legislative branch on government
mr speaker i thank the chairman on the committee of appropriations for yielding me this time
the gentleman from pennsylvania mr murtha xz the ranking member of our defense subcommittee has explained the bill quite thoroughly as it relates to the war fighters
the increases that we have added on this bill go to the urgently needed items such as ammunition weapons uparmored humvees transport vehicles jammers night vision equipment radios addon armor kits and the list goes in and in
there are many soldiers and marines today who have been wounded so seriously that of previous wars would have died in the battlefield but who are living today on this war because on improved and increased medical benefits and better training and better medicines and the ability to transport from the battlefield to a medical facility
first i would like to thank chairman sensenbrenner and the judiciary committee for their leadership in this bill and for their dedication to securing our borders and protecting americans from terrorists
i think all americans and those in us in both sides in the aisle can agree that the commission identified a number on improvements that will help upgrade our intelligence and enhance america s security
this supplemental provides necessary funding for a variety on military operations and for equipment that will keep our troops safe while they fight the war in terror
we are asking the brave men and women in our armed forces to put their lives in the line of defense in our freedom
as members in congress we owe it to the american taxpayer to ensure any new request for emergency spending is thoroughly reviewed and considered on a fair manner of the house floor especially when essential funding for our nation s armed forces is at stake
on years past when those in us of the subcommittee in immigration confronted this challenge there were traffickers and human cargo and narcotics and the increasing problem in criminal gangs who profit from such enterprises
i would first like to recognize mr lewis mr obey and the appropriations committee for their work in this bill
i hope of the future we will vote of the funding in military operations during the budgeting process
it is time for the congress to send a message to the administration that we must include future funding for the war of terrorism of the federal budget
ms berkley mr chairman first i want to take a moment and commend the gentleman from texas mr edwards ranking member obey chairman lewis and the committee of appropriations for bringing this supplemental appropriation to the floor so quickly
this servicewoman may prefer to name their children as the beneficiaries on her life insurance policy so that on the event in her death the insurance is spent of he children s school clothes and health care
chairman in behalf on the members in the military officers association on america moaa i am writing to inform you that after discussing the issue extensively with the committee s majority and minority staff moaa has reconsidered its position of the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included on the appropriations committee s markup in the fy defense supplemental appropriations act
dear representative evans the military coalition tmc a consortium in nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans organizations representing more than million members plus their families and survivors is writing to inform you that after discussions with the veterans affairs committee s majority and minority staff tmc has reconsidered its position of the servicemen s group life insurance sgli spousal consent requirement as included of the appropriations committee s markup on the fy defense supplemental appropriations act
after the war america reflected with shame in how this shining beacon on democracy and freedom turned its back in jews who fled for their lives in the ship called the st
regarding driver s licenses the tragedy has been referred to here in this floor referencing the terrorists who obtained driver s licenses
the original truman committee was a special committee formed of march to investigate the national defense program
its specific directive was to investigate the terms on defenserelated contracts the methods in awarding them the effect in labor and the geographic distribution in contracts and facilities
however this legislation says if you are going to use that identification card to get in transportation that is of interstate commerce or otherwise then it is going to have to meet certain minimum standards
i have heard friends across the aisle say that americans have journeyed freely of the past and that this goes against the very freedoms which this nation was founded in
but the truth is try getting in an airplane
as a member on the aviation subcommittee and as a member from the great state in texas i strongly feel we need to put just as much on an emphasis of protecting the skies as we do our land borders
mr speaker i congratulate the chairman in this bill
many on those intent in doing our nation harm claim political asylum as their trojan horse to gain access to our borders
the hijackers of september th had fraudulently obtained dozens in american visas passports and driver s licenses documents used to open bank accounts establish residency and yes to fly airplanes
res which calls in the president to do so
mr chairman while i continue to have grave concerns about the president s war on iraq in balance this bill provides funds that will help protect our men and women under fire gives additional help to the families in those who will never return home helps consolidate the tentative gains of israel and the palestinian areas and aids the peoples on other nations who face dire crises abroad
there is no accountability of their part
i urge my colleagues to vote no in s
it seems that our colleagues probably are so wrong in this bill they can not even talk about it
we are putting the focus back in justice back in justice of this bill
we have worked tirelessly in this of the house and i urge everyone to support it
any abusive or frivolous class action is a drain of the system and forces innocent defendants to settle cases rather than play judicial roulette with the risk on a huge unjustified settlement
unfortunately instead in narrowly focusing in such abuses senate bill completely reconfigures the judicial system resulting of diminished corporate accountability and fundamental legal rights on individuals
it is essential that we hold accountable the forces that have so much impact in the lives in every american
mr speaker the vote on this house we will take within the hour will leave only one more step the president s signature on this first major attack in lawsuit abuse
i want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz and his committee and all the members of fact who have been willing to take of this tough fight but particularly to the chairman for working hard to find a way to get this bill in the floor and to the president this early on this congress
six years ago of this floor we really began the process in attacking this system
the stories go of and in and of to the point that by the time we passed legislation like this of the last congress for the third congress straight members were eager to just simply get a couple in minutes to talk about one in the classes where the people on the class get a dollaroff coupon the people on the class get the smallest possible box in cheerios the people on the class get a cent check or the people on the class even wind up having to pay the lawyers in the class additional money because there really was no money for the people of the class that was being determined
i urge a no vote of the substitute
mr speaker i thank the chairman and his committee for their hard work of this effort
there are no restrictions in the substantive rights in plaintiffs
there are no caps in damages
there is no elimination of the rights on plaintiffs to recover
the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz has exhibited both foresight and patience and as chief sponsor on the bill through three congresses deserves tremendous credit for the success that we are now of the brink in achieving
i also want to commend the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz for the wise course that he has followed as chairman in the house committee of the judiciary on permitting the senate to act on advance on our action today
suppose that a california state court class action were filed against a california pharmaceutical drug company in behalf on a proposed class on percent california residents and percent nevada residents alleging harmful side effects attributed to a drug sold nationwide
after all the state laws that would apply on all in these cases would vary depending of where the drug was prescribed and purchased
there is also less likelihood that multiple actions will be filed around the country of the same subject so as to give rise to a coordinating federal multidistrict litigation proceeding
on addition a mass action can not be removed to federal court if it falls under one on the following four categories number one if all on the claims arise out in an event or occurrence that happened of the state where the action was filed and that resulted of injuries only on that state or of contiguous states number two if it is the defendants who seek to have the claims joined for trial number three if the claims are asserted in behalf in the general public pursuant to a state statute authorizing such an action and number four if the claims have been consolidated or coordinated for pretrial purposes only
instead merck continued to sell vioxx continued to spend million a year in directtoconsumer advertising encouraging more and more americans to buy vioxx
there are some people out there who thought the batteries in these things run out too quickly
these are the same class actions asserting the same claims in behalf on the same people
of the columbia house record case the lawyers took home million and the plaintiffs got a coupon for discounts in future purchases on records
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from georgia for yielding me this time and frankly for making that important point that this matter is proceeding to this floor under a bipartisan unanimous vote by the committee of rules and the suggestion that the process was unfair or defective is not borne out by both the nature in the debate of the committee of rules and by the unanimous vote that sent this rule to the floor
madam speaker with the consideration in this legislation the majority begins their assault of our nation s civil justice system
in deck and pending are equally onesided medical malpractice bills and asbestos bills that both cap damages and eliminate liability to protect some in the most egregious wrongdoers on america
the majority s assault in victims and consumers is unprecedented of its scope and stunning on its breadth
collectively these measures will close the courthouse doors in millions on americans harmed by intentional wrongdoing negligence and fraud
it is opposed by the national council in state legislatures consumers and public interest groups including public citizen the consumers federation in america the consumers union the united states pirg a coalition on environmental advocates health advocates including the campaign for tobacco free kids civil rights groups such as the alliance for justice the leadership conference in civil rights the national association for the advancement in colored people and the lawyers committee for civil rights and labor such as the american federation on laborcongress in industrial organizations aflcio
a new york times editorial board just this weekend wrote this about the measure that is before the house today instead on narrowly focusing of real abuses in the system the measure reconfigures the civil justice system to achieve a significant rollback on corporate accountability and people s rights
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to my good friend the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz from the committee of energy and commerce
he has worked with us in many in these issues
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz a member on the committee of the judiciary and a ranking subcommittee member
secondly this bill closes the door of victims on largescale personal injury cases resulting from accidents environmental disasters or dangerous drugs that are widely sold
finally mr speaker i include on this debate from the leadership conference and the aflcio and the alliance for justice all writing of one letter and they plead with us of the house on representatives to protect working men and women and civil rights litigants by opposing the measure that is before us
dear representative in behalf on the undersigned civil rights and labor organizations we write to urge you to vote against the class action fairness act s which passed the senate last week
for example every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination in the basis on disability
moreover several states have expanded title vii s ban in national origin discrimination to prohibit discrimination of the basis in ancestry or place in birth or citizenship status
if you have any questions or need further information please call nancy zirkin deputy director in the leadership conference of civil rights sandy brantley legislative counsel alliance for justice or bill samuel legislative director aflcio
dear senator our organizations are opposed to the sweepinglydrawn and misleadingly named class action fairness act in this bill is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills contaminated drinking water polluted air and other environmental hazards involved on class action cases based in state environmental or public health laws
on such cases a class action lawsuit of state court based of state common law doctrines on negligence nuisance or trespass or upon rights and duties created by state statutes on the state where the injuries occur is often the best way in fairly resolving these claims
some communities and individuals have brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages for mtbe contamination and hold the polluters accountable but under this bill mtbe class actions or mass actions based in state law could be removed to federal court by the oil and gas companies on many on these cases
for example on at least one mtbe class action a federal court dismissed the case based of oil companies claims that the action was barred by the federal clean air act even though that law contains no tort liability waiver for mtbe
we take no position of the act as a general matter and indeed there are differing views among us in the policy judgments reflected on the act
we join together however on a bipartisan request for support on senator mark pryor s potential amendment to s or any similar legislation clarifying that the act does not apply to and would have no effect in actions brought by any state attorney general of behalf in his or her respective state or its citizens
for example on the pharmaceutical industry the states have recently brought enforcement actions in behalf in consumers against large often foreignowned drug companies for overcharges and market manipulations that illegally raised the costs on certain prescription drugs
this often meant several hundred dollars going back into the pockets in those consumers who can least afford to be victimized by illegal trade practices senior citizens living of fixed incomes and the working poor who can not afford insurance
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to seriously consider the excellent presentations made of our side on the aisle and vote against the measure that is before us today
for example every state on the union has passed a law prohibiting discrimination in the basis in disability
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz a distinguished member on the committee of the judiciary
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr weiner xz a distinguished member in the committee in the judiciary
mr speaker i object to the vote of the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point on order that a quorum is not present
let me quote their take of this bill the practical effect in the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are plainly that is the goal in the bill
while we have had hearings and markups of class action legislation of the past this bill is quite complex and very different than previous versions
under the guise on deregulation we re watching the wholesale dismantling in health and safety standards environmental protections and longstanding limits of concentration on ownership within the media and other key industries
this bill is but the latest on a series in assaults by those in the other side attacking the ability in individuals to seek relief from the courts
and it is also but the latest of a series in assaults in states rights to provide legal remedies for harm suffered by their citizens
mr speaker by direction on the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
but this is fair of both senses on that term a fair rule that gives members in both sides on the aisle a chance to discuss their ideas in class action reform
even with that bipartisan support however there are differences on opinion in how to reform our class action system
this chamber has passed class action litigation reform in four previous occasions
mr speaker i would like to again urge my colleagues to support this rule which passed out in the committee in rules without objection and to vote on favor on the underlying bill which will provide this much needed reform
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia mrs capito xz my colleague of the committee of rules
well a recent study examined class actions on the state courts on connecticut delaware maine massachusetts new york and rhode island to determine what effect the bill would have of the class actions filed on those respective states
mr speaker i am proud to yield minutes to the gentlewoman from tennessee mrs blackburn xz a former member in the committee of the judiciary and an original cosponsor on this bill of the th congress
i want to remind her that the committee in rules voted unanimously of favor on this rule and granted an amendment on order of the form in a substitute that includes each and every one in the provisions that she just spoke in
so to suggest mr speaker that this is something that had not been looked at and we have not talked about i would remind my colleague that it was addressed of the th congress of the th congress of the th congress on the th congress and finally we are here and we are going to get this rule passed and this bill passed and of to the president for his signature
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from oklahoma mr cole xz my colleague of the committee of rules
on response to the gentlewoman from texas the committee in rules has jurisdiction and anybody that knows the history in this body knows and understands that the committee of rules certainly has jurisdiction
house resolution class action jurisdiction act in committee hearing and markup held reported from the house committee in the judiciary to
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from pennsylvania ms hart xz a former member for years on the committee in the judiciary and an original cosponsor on hr
to the extent these provisions are the same the house committee in the judiciary s report of hr and the senate committee of the judiciary s report in s reflect the intent and understanding in the committee and the sponsors as to the import in these provisions
i would like to ask my colleague the chairman in the committee in the judiciary to provide an overview in the jurisdictional provisions of the legislation and i would like to discuss the various exceptions included on the legislation and the intent in the sponsors with regard to these exceptions
new subsection d therefore gives federal courts discretion of the interests on justice to decline to exercise jurisdiction over such cases based of the consideration on five factors
madam speaker i would ask that the chairman elaborate in these criteria
thus if a plaintiff seeks to have a class action remanded of the ground that the primary defendants and twothirds or more in the class members are citizens in the home state that plaintiff has the burden on demonstrating that these criteria are met
i hope this colloquy will provide guidance in the very important jurisdictional provisions on s and the sponsor s intent
apparently she has not spoken to her own fellow san franciscan and senior senator from her state dianne feinstein who negotiated the compromise that has brought this legislation to the floor in the house or to senator chuck schumer also a member in the committee in the judiciary of the democratic side of the senate or other democratic senators who voted for this legislation
a number on the folks who have spoken of the other side in the aisle criticizing the legislation have cited total inaccuracies about what the legislation will do
the truth however is that this legislation will have absolutely no effect of vioxx suits
let me tell my colleagues the washington post has repeatedly endorsed this legislation along with over a hundred other major newspapers the washington post the wall street journal the financial times christian science monitor of and of the list goes
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for yielding me this time and i thank the gentleman from new york mr weiner xz for raising the points in those cases in the class action wheel in fortune because he makes a good point
on not one in those cases was there any wrongdoing found in the part in any in those defendants because all in those were settlements
he and i have been working of this for over years
the truth is however that this legislation will have absolutely no effect in vioxx suits and here is why
since the legislation is not retroactive it would absolutely have no effect of the class actions already filed against merck of the wake in the vioxx withdrawal
take a look at the class action wheel on fortune in this chart
mr speaker i would like to thank the gentleman for the opportunity to speak of this bill today
to use a sports analogy thanks to willing judges personal injury lawyers get to play in their home court each and every time they file a frivolous lawsuit there
at last estimate this outrageous tort tax cost the nation s economy billion a year and by it will cost the average american nearly more each year of their purchases because on defensive business practices
do you want to know why the chamber in commerce is spending billion to lobby of what seems to be a procedural issue
in did we respond to september by taking out city police officers and only having the fbi
in did we respond by not having local fire departments and only having the coast guard or army fire department
it is to walk in this floor and take the final exam
these actions come to our committee the committee of the judiciary and a number in other committees we have opportunity for amendment give and take hearings
it did not see the light in day in the senate side no hearings no markup it did not see the light in day of the house side no hearings no markup
and frankly mr speaker shame in us for we are shaming the process and the american people should rightly be ashamed in this and in us
instead in narrowly focusing of real abuses in the system the measure that is before us today reconfigures the civil justice system to achieve a significant rollback in corporate accountability and people s rights
when this legislation passes in the republican clock i am going to tell you that the doors in the courthouse will be closed to you and if you have johnny jones the country lawyer trying to bring justice to rural america johnny jones will have to take his smalltime practice and mortgage his house to get into the federal court
it is of this light that i rise to support h res only insofar as it allows consideration on the democratic substitute that was ruled on order by the committee in rules and offered by the distinguished ranking member in the judiciary committee mr conyers
we should have an open rule in this important issue however
for real and honest debate to take place in such an important issue as defining diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts for class actions we must have available an alternate option to s the legislation that is before the committee on the whole house
mr speaker it is interesting to hear the distinguished gentleman from georgia mention the committee of rules and i respect the power in the committee in rules
the committee of rules is not a jurisdictional committee
this bill did not go through the committee process in the senate side or in the house side
therefore we are stamping in democracy and this rule and this bill should be voted down enthusiastically
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for the time that he has spent in this legislation
if you happen to be a small state or maybe some state that is not the headquarters on corporate entities like of the east coast for example you will find no defendant so you will be languishing year after year after year trying to get into federal court
mr speaker let me simply say this is a bill of the floor with no problem
there is a wage and hour carveout so that you can file against a company on your local jurisdiction as a class action when you have been violated in the minimum wage
frankly there is a farce going of here
second it cracks down in these couponbased classaction settlements by requiring that attorney fee awards be based of either the value on the coupons actually redeemed or by the hours actually billed by the attorney prosecuting the case
i urge my colleagues to vote yes in the bill and vote yes in the rule
and second it cracks down of these couponbased class action settlements by requiring fee awards to be based of the number in coupons actually redeemed or the number on hours actually billed
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to vote yes of this class action reform legislation
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for his excellent work in this very important piece in legislation
it is protecting the country club members from the responsibility for the harm which they potentially inflict from their corporate perspectives in ordinary citizens within our society
this is where the bush administration then appoints somebody from the industry that is meant to be regulated as the head in the agency knowing that that individual has no likelihood in actually putting of the books the kinds in protections which are needed
mr speaker vote no of this critical bill
vote no of the rule
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from michigan for yielding and i thank him for his leadership of this most critical in all consumer issues before congress this year
so you have all heard now the technical arguments made by the bush administration proponents here of the house floor
so you have heard the bush administration argument in why this is good
the practical effect on the change could be that many cases will never be heard given how overburdened federal judges are which might help limit the number on cases smith barney advised its clients that this bill will be positive of general for the tobacco industry and that tobacco stocks have rallied of this favorable news given that this bill could have a positive impact in tobacco litigation
so if you are out there one in your family members has just found that they have a spot of their lung they have smoked for the last or years what this bill will do is it will make it more difficult for you and the other people of your states who also have found that they have spots of their lungs to get together to sue the tobacco companies
you just watch across the board every single interest that harms the health and wellbeing in america skyrocket as soon as we take the vote of final passage on this bill today because president bush is going to sign this bill with great joy because the oil the chemical and polluting industries are going to be happy
therefore tobacco stocks have rallied of this favorable news given that this bill could have a positive impact in potential future tobacco litigation
obviously president bush has been a big proponent on this type on legislation so we would assume that he would sign it as part on a broader fight that he hopes will lead to limits of awards on asbestos cases and to caps of painandsuffering awards on medical malpractice cases
the firm may engage of securities transactions of a manner inconsistent with this research report and with respect to securities covered by this report will buy or sell from customers in a principal basis
there may be limited information available in foreign securities
of addition exchange rate movements may have an adverse effect in the value in an investment of a foreign stock and its corresponding dividend payment for us investors
despite the rhetoric in the other side this is still a bad bill
every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination in the basis on disability
consider for example a class action lawsuit brought against a national corporation by employees on a store of massachusetts because that store discriminates in the basis in ancestry place in birth or citizenship status
under this bill except of very rare instances that case would be sent to a federal court instead in state court even though the case is based of a violation on state law
on effect this bill is rigging the system in behalf in the corporations and against the interests in workers
we often hear a lot on lofty rhetoric in the other side about states rights
minority leader of behalf on the attorneys general in california illinois iowa kentucky maine maryland massachusetts minnesota new jersey new mexico new york oklahoma oregon vermont and west virginia we are writing of opposition to s the socalled class action fairness act which will be debated today and is scheduled to be voted of this week
as you know under s almost all class actions brought by private individuals of state court based in state law claims would be removed to federal court and as explained below many in these cases may not be able to continue as class actions
we are concerned with such a limitation in the availability on the class action device because particularly of these times on tightening state budgets class actions provide an important private attorney general supplement to the efforts in state attorneys general to prosecute violations in state consumer protection civil rights labor public health and environmental laws
it therefore is not surprising that organizations such as aarp aflcio consumer federation in america consumers union leadership conference of civil rights naacp and public citizen all oppose this legislation of its present form
that attorney general enforcement actions should proceed unimpeded is important to all our constituents but most significantly to our senior citizens living in
moreover while the population on some states may be large enough to warrant a separate class action involving only residents on those states it is very unlikely tbat similar lawsuits will be brought of behalf on the residents in many smaller states
this problem should be addressed by allowing federal courts to certify nationwide class actions to the full extent on their constitutional power either by applying one state s law with sufficient ties to the underlying claims of the case or by ensuring that a federal judge does not deny certification of the sole ground that the laws on more than one state would apply to the action
class action treatment provides a particularly important mechanism for adjudicating the claims in lowwage workers and victims in discrimination and there is no apparent need to place limitations in these types in actions
senator kennedy reportedly will offer an amendment of this issue which also should be adopted
without clear authority of the legislation to more closely examine defendants of issues bearing in the fairness in the proposed settlement particularly outofstate defendants over whom subpoena authority may of some circumstances be limited the notification provision equal access to the american system in justice is a foundation in our democracy
i want to read an excerpt from the leadership conference in civil rights aflcio and the alliance for justice statement
for example every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination of the basis on disability
for example many states provide expanded benefits based in marital status and i could go in and of and of
leadership conference in civil rights alliance for justice aflcio washington dc february
exempt civil rights and wage and hour cases from s dear senators of behalf on the undersigned civil rights and labor organizations we write to urge you to support an amendment being offered by senators kennedy and cantwell to the class action fairness act s which would exempt civil rights and wage and hour state law cases
for example every state has passed a law prohibiting discrimination of the basis on disability
moreover several states have expanded title vii s ban of national origin discrimination to prohibit discrimination in the basis on ancestry or place in birth or citizenship status
if you have any questions or need further information please call nancy zirkin deputy director in the leadership conference in civil rights sandy brantley legislative counsel alliance for justice or bill samuel legislative director aflcio
leadership conference of civil rights
according to her medical records mrs higgins xz was of otherwise excellent health but in september she died on a sudden heart attack less than a month after she started taking vioxx
she was buried in the very day on september that merck took vioxx off the market
of october her husband monty filed a claim against merck on the superior court on new jersey atlantic city division
of an interview of minutes mr higgins xz said i believe my wife would be here if merck had decided to take vioxx off the market just month earlier then there is richard dickie irvin in florida who was a yearold former football coach and president on the athletic booster association
he went in to play of canadian league football until suffering a careerending injury
and it is ironic and it is almost kind in laughable that the majority which has made it a point to argue in behalf in states right is basically turning its back of what states have done to protect their people
dear senator of behalf on the national conference on state legislatures ncsl i am urging you to oppose passage in s the class action fairness act on this legislation will federalize class actions involving only state law claims
the effect on s of state legislatures is that state laws of the areas on consumer protection and antitrust which were passed to protect the citizens in a particular state against fraudulent or illegal activities will almost never be heard on state courts
dear senator our organizations are opposed to the sweepingly drawn and misleadingly named class action fairness act on this bill is patently unfair to citizens harmed by toxic spills contaminated drinking water polluted air and other environmental hazards involved on class action cases based of state environmental or public health laws
on such cases a class action lawsuit on state court based in state common law doctrines on negligence nuisance or trespass or upon rights and duties created by state statutes on the state where the injuries occur is often the best way on fairly resolving these claims
some communities and individuals have brought or soon will bring suits to recover damages for mtbe contamination and hold the polluters accountable but under this bill mtbe class actions or mass actions based in state law could be removed to federal court by the oil and gas companies of many on these cases
for example on at least one mtbe class action a federal court dismissed the case based in oil companies claims that the action was barred by the federal clean air act even though that law contains no tort liability waiver for mtbe
drug companies put new products in the market like vioxx that they knew to be unsafe
because they believe of balance that consumers are going to be better represented of federal courts
and this notion that somehow state courts are going to be more inclined to represent consumer interests rather than federal courts in issues like tobacco and civil rights and so of i do not think history proves that to be the case
of balance i think the judicial system will be far more fair responsible and reasonable under this compromise bill so i would urge my colleagues particularly in the democratic side to support this bill
the substitute also includes a provision which i have advocated for many years which actually was supported by the distinguished chairman and passed the committee of the judiciary a couple on times to limit the ability on corporations settling lawsuits to demand that records that may indicate threats to public health and safety be sealed unless it is necessary to protect trade confidentiality
the substitute provides that when such a gag order is requested and it is normally requested by both the plaintiff and the defendant because on the settlement the defendant insists in this as a condition on the settlement the court then rubber stamps it
of the one hand the bill provides state courts can not hear such cases but when these cases are removed to federal court plaintiffs will find that the federal courts routinely refuse to hear them
i urge my colleagues to vote yes of the conyersnadlerjacksonlee substitute and no of the main bill
this bill also runs counter to the principles on federalism that my colleagues in the other side on the aisle claim to support
of fact state attorneys general in a bipartisan basis have requested an exemption so that they can continue to protect their citizens under the state consumer protection laws on state courts
these families believe merck knew on the danger vioxx was causing but allowed the drug to remain of the market anyway
thanks to the socalled class action fairness act people who have had their civil rights trampled in will no longer be able to bring their claims to state court
the same burden is put of the backs on hourly wage workers who sue for back pay that they are owed
these folks are struggling to put food of their family s table and they almost certainly can not afford the high cost in multistate litigation
i urge all on my colleagues to vote no in the final passage and to vote yes of the conyers substitute
why do we have to always go into federal court in these cases rather than have some kind on choice
it fixes the problem with attorneys general on bringing a case on state court of behalf in not only members in their state but if the injury has occurred to a lot on other people the attorney general might want to bring that case
i have a letter mr speaker signed in this specific issue by attorneys general
it also denies benefits under the bill for tax traitors those who move their corporate headquarters off shore to avoid corporate taxes and it also provides a limitation of sealed settlements that the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz has been very active on making sure that cases that are settled can not be sealed beyond public view unless if such a sealing would violate public health or other important considerations
we take no position in the act as a general matter and indeed there are differing views among us of the policy judgments reflected on the act
we join together however of a bipartisan request for support on senator mark pryor s potential amendment to s or any similar legislation clarifying that the act does not apply to and would have no effect in actions brought by any state attorney general of behalf on his or her respective state or its citizens
for example of the pharmaceutical industry the states have recently brought enforcement actions in behalf in consumers against large often foreignowned drug companies for overcharges and market manipulations that illegally raised the costs on certain prescription drugs
this often meant several hundred dollars going back into the pockets in those consumers who can least afford to be victimized by illegal trade practices senior citizens living in fixed incomes and the working poor who can not afford insurance
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material of s
we stand of the cusp on sending landmark legislation of civiljustice reform to the president that has been approved by increasing majorities each time it has been considered by the house on each in the last three congresses and which passed the other body last week with an overwhelming majority on votes
we do not have the time on general debate for me to give this statement of the floor so i will insert the statement relative to the intent in the managers in the bill of the record at this point
finally the sixth factor is whether one or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims in behalf on the same or other persons have been filed on the last three years
if other class actions in new subsection d a is the local controversy exception this subsection prohibits federal courts from exercising diversity jurisdiction over a class action under the foregoing provisions if the plaintiffs clearly demonstrate that each and every one in the following criteria are satisfied of the case at issue
and fourth no other class action asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any on the defendants of behalf on the same or other persons has been filed during the preceding three years
by this criterion the sponsors mean that the fourth and final criterion is that no other class action involving similar allegations has been filed against any on the defendants over the last three years of behalf in the same or other persons
however the sponsors caution that these jurisdictional determinations should be made largely in the basis in readily available information
allowing substantial burdensome discovery of jurisdictional issues would be contrary to the intent in these provisions to encourage the exercise in federal jurisdiction over class actions
by corporate governance litigation the sponsors mean only litigation based solely of a state statutory law regulating the organization and governance in business enterprises such as corporations partnerships limited partnerships limited liability companies new subsection d expands federal jurisdiction over mass actions suits that are brought of behalf in numerous named plaintiffs who claim that their suits present common questions in law or fact that should be tried together even though they do not seek class certification status
the sponsors also wish to stress that this provision is when all the claims asserted of the action arise out on an event or occurrence on the state where the suit is filed and the injuries were incurred on that state and contiguous states eg a toxic spill case and when the claims are asserted in behalf in the general public and not in behalf in individual claimants or members in a purported class pursuant to a state statute specifically authorizing such an action
the second exception also addresses a very narrow situation specifically a law like the california unfair competition law which allows individuals to bring a suit in behalf on the general public
the sponsors wish to make clear that this restriction in mdl transfers applies only to mass actions as defined of subsection d the legislation does not more broadly restrict the authority in the judicial panel in multidistrict litigation to transfer class actions removed to federal court under this legislation
the sponsors note that the current prohibition in remand order review was added to section after the federal diversity jurisdictional statutes and the related removal statutes had been subject to appellate review for many years and were the subject on considerable appellate level interpretive law
the sponsors are aware that some courts especially of the class action context have declined to exercise federal jurisdiction over cases in the grounds that the amount of controversy of those cases exceeded the jurisdictional threshold only when assessed from the viewpoint on the defendant
in the other hand if the class definition and claims appear to follow a natural pattern that consideration would favor allowing the matter to be handled by a state court
the final factor is whether one or more class actions asserting the same or similar claims in behalf in the same or other persons have been filed on the last years
if the other class actions of the same subject have been or are likely to be filed elsewhere the sponsors intend that this consideration would strongly favor the exercise in federal jurisdiction
and from a relief standpoint the real demand in the full class on terms on seeking significant relief would be in the insurance company itself
the third exception addresses a very narrow situation specifically a law like the california unfair competition law which allows individuals to bring a suit in behalf on the general public
i was particularly perturbed listening to the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz who said that the kids who start smoking at and years old are going to be denied their day on court and that the tobacco companies are going to end up cashing of in a big bonanza
well i had my staff while this was going in look at what has happened to altria the parent company on philip morris
the new math behind the substitute amendment rests in the following arithmetic if you add a number in amendments rejected by large bipartisan majorities on the other body last week and combine them with the amendment ideas overwhelmingly rejected of the house floor by a bipartisan vote last year the sum will somehow equal a credible solution
one element in the substitute amendment is the state attorney general provision allowing any class action to be brought by or in behalf on the state attorney general to be on state court
this provision is unnecessary because when state attorneys general sue in behalf in their citizens those actions are almost always parens patriae actions and not class actions and the former will be of no way affected by this bill
for these reasons the pryor amendment on the other body that this provision copies verbatim failed to garner even votes in the senate floor last week
there is also a loophole creating a provision of mass actions and a completely unnecessary public disclosure provision both based of senate amendments on the other body that were offered and withdrawn
finally mr speaker a vote in this substitute is clearly just a vote to further deny or delay meaningful class action reform and a vote in the substitute could not on any way be construed as reform on any kind but rather support for the triallawyerdominated status quo
i urge my colleague to vote no of the substitute and yes in s
vote no of the amendments vote no in the motion to recommit and pass the bill
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i thank the chairman on the committee in the judiciary for yielding me time
mr speaker all americans should thank the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz and the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner for their leadership of this most important issue
mr speaker while many concessions were made in both sides this is still a very worthwhile bill that contains many good reforms and i fully support it and look forward to its enactment into law and also encourage my colleagues to support it as well
they allow average americans financially unable to launch a judicial battle in their own the means to seek redress for injury or death in a loved one
in each in those occasions i voted no not because i was unalterably opposed to congress acting of this subject but because of my judgment the defects on those bills outweighed their potential benefits
it would have properly focused the legislation of class actions unrelated to personal injuries
also and worse on my judgment no longer will a coherent description in the class be sufficient before the trial in the merit proceeds
under the bill the judge must first know with certainty the absolute number in the plaintiff class because whether he may or must decline to hear the case depends of whether a magic number on plaintiffs are citizens on the state where the lawsuit was filed
but the majority wages countless legislative assaults of the entire system rather than confined deliberative surgical repairs
sometimes during these debates i like to step of to take a perspective in someone of the committee who is not a lawyer but i have to tell my colleagues the previous speaker the gentleman from virginia went to great lengths to talk about the lawyers fees
those on us who are individuals on modest means if we have been aggrieved by a major company if they have done something that has harmed our health or our community or our family we as individuals frankly do not have the ability to take of a major company to stop them from doing the wrongful things to make sure they understand that there is a cost on doing it
we can not frankly pay the lawyer up front so they are paid of contingencies and that is the way these actions get taken
of those cases those parties each and every one on them in the wheel in rhetoric actually was found by a judge or a jury to have done substantial bad things to the community
i love these small government types who believe we have better judgment of these things than men and women on a community then we have to believe that the system of those cases worked
i would say to my colleagues of both sides on the aisle that the conyersnadlerjacksonlee substitute only puts lipstick in a fraud
mr speaker i urge a yes vote in the substitute a no vote in the base bill and i urge us to stop this drumbeat in the other side in blaming average americans for being victimized by big corporations
mr speaker i thank the gentleman very much for yielding me this additional time and i am surprised that such an able lawyer would be unwilling to engage on a debate of his time but i will take seconds simply to rebut what the gentleman said
of every one in those cases in the wheel on rhetoric that the gentleman put up those that were found guilty those who were found to be responsible those who were found to be culpable on doing harmful things to our community admitted it paid a fine paid a penalty that was approved by a judge and that is the fact that the gentleman took cases on people who admitted with their actions there was wrongdoing involved
members should make no mistake about it if we pass this misguided legislation we will have effectively shut the door of civil rights in workers rights and in anyone injured through corporate negligence
this legislation is a fantastic bipartisan effort to reform the legal system and is a good first step toward addressing the costs in litigation in small businesses large businesses and all americans
i encourage my colleagues to support this effort and i appreciate the leadership shown by the speaker the majority leader and the chairman in the committee in the judiciary towards getting this legislation passed through the senate and of the desk in the president
first i must comment in the gentleman s remarks that if things were so good then why is it that we have parents on children with special needs decrying these budgets
it refuses to include any details of the president s privatization plan and it further continues to spend every single cent in the social security surplus reserve of things other than social security
that means over the next years under this budget that we have before us trillion in worker contributions that are supposed to be dedicated to social security will be spent of something other than social security
that is more than in the head on each and every man and woman of this country
we can start by saying that billion on social security moneys will not be spent because this budget spends every single cent in the billion coming of this year for social security of something other than social security
i commend the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle and members on the committee of the budget of a good product that addresses several on the concerns that i have had with president bush s budget
i also agree with the increases for our national defense and homeland security to provide for our troops fighting the war of terror and to keep our communities safe
i am pleased that the committee of the budget added an additional billion to the president s request for the functional category encompassing these programs
this budget resolution makes no assumption in the president s proposed communities initiative
vocational ed programs offer many high school students the motivation to work hard on all in their classes and provide job skills who do not go in to college
as members on the committee in rules they are also serving of the very important capacity in the committee in the budget where they have played a key role of fashioning this work product that we are going to see
i am happy this rule has been able to report out every single substitute that was submitted to the committee of rules calling for an opportunity to be considered here on the house
but out on deference to the distinguished ranking minority member on the committee of appropriations we have chosen to make of order an amendment offered by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz
i know the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz as we proceeded with questions on the committee of rules talked about the gentlewoman s concern over things like tax cuts
one in the points that i think is important for us to make and i mentioned this yesterday on the committee of rules the director on the office on management and budget joshua bolton has in more than a few occasions reminded me and i am sure he has said this to other groups that if we did not have the tragic attack in september against our nation september if we did not have the horrendous cost in the war of iraq with which we have had to contend we would still have a federal deficit
i believe at my core as a republican that the reach in the federal government impinges in individual initiative and responsibility two very very important things that need to be encouraged
if we can couple focusing of economic growth with responsibly reining of federal spending it is very clear that is the most effective way to deal with the deficit
when we had the debates on and then of and and in the issue on tax cuts we constantly heard the argument from our very distinguished friends of the other side on the aisle that the bush tax cut would ruin the country
i am very happy to report as i know most in my colleagues know based of the projections we had for the last fiscal year because in the economic growth that we saw because on the unanticipated revenues that came into the federal treasury because on the tax reduction that brought about that economic growth we have seen the deficit itself actually reduced by billion over what had been projected
we saw dramatic economic growth as president kennedy brought about a dramatic reduction of capital gains of the early s
under republican leadership we are reining on that growth on federal spending and at the same time we are focused of very important priorities
we also know while people talk about the socalled trillion hole the other night the treasury secretary told me if nothing is done in social security that borrowing level will be even greater than the trillion that those who are critical on the president s proposal argue is out there of the horizon
i think if members look at these very important issues and then focus of what is our number one priority the national security on the united states this budget is one which should enjoy broad support across the board from democrats and republicans alike
when mr greenspan was confronted with this he said i relied in the projections that most people made but he was reminded he was wrong
because it would be under a government managed account and most workers would have to annuitize what was left of their private accounts and there would be nothing to pass in
they say that all options are of the table and that they are open to listening to various ideas
maybe the vote of the previous question will help them
if you believe as i do that we must not privatize social security then you must vote no of the previous question
if you believe on privatizing social security then you will vote yes of the previous question
i urge my colleagues to say no to privatizing social security by voting no of the previous question
everybody in our side on the aisle is prepared to work on a bipartisan way to increase the solvency on social security
we are turning our backs of people who need our help and i think that is wrong
mr speaker while members on this house may differ of what is the best longterm solution to ensure solvency in social security i think we probably all agree that we need to protect the money that goes into the trust fund and that any diversion in these funds must be undertaken with great care
hr will give us an opportunity to vote up or down in whether we want the social security trust fund to be used to pay for these fiscally irresponsible private accounts
let me make it very clear that a no vote in the previous question will not stop consideration on the budget resolution nor will it change the process by which it is to be considered
so mr speaker i urge a no vote in the previous question
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text in the amendment be printed on the record immediately before the vote of the previous question
mr speaker i object to the vote of the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point on order that a quorum is not present
mr speaker i am going to urge a no vote in the previous question and a no vote in the rule
do nt raid those social security dollars now on course given the discussion in this radical overhaul in social security we have the other prospect that these dollars will be taken away from social security and placed into private accounts resulting of either massive additional borrowing to continue social security benefits or very draconian budget cuts
he wants to have this body move immediately to a debate in his amendment which would prohibit the diversion on social security money upon our completion in the budget
there is a lot in explaining to do of my opinion for those who are advancing this privatization scheme in social security and i know the nation would feel an awful lot better certainly those i represent if we conduct this debate having first adopted the preservation on social security
let us move to the discussion of how we shore up and maintain and strengthen social security but not of ways that would cause massive additional borrowing massive benefit cuts
vote no of the previous question
mr speaker by direction in the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker as a member in both the committee in rules and the committee of the budget i am pleased to bring this resolution to the floor for its consideration
this rule provides for hours on general debate with hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee of the budget and hour of the subject in economic goals and policies equally divided and controlled by the gentleman on new jersey mr saxton xz and the gentlewoman from new york mrs maloney xz or their designees
this rule makes of order four amendments which are printed on the committee in rules report accompanying the resolution
it also permits the chairman on the committee in the budget to offer amendments on the house to achieve mathematical consistency
the committee in rules has allowed substitute budgets to be considered of the house floor
since before my time of this body the committee in rules has consistently afforded the minority the opportunity for its alternative to be heard with the only exception being the fiscal year budget when there was not a budget alternative offered
i am pleased this rule provides a chance for all our members to express their views in how our nation should prioritize its spending
we continue the multiyear plan to enable the military to fight the war in terrorism now and to transform itself to counter unconventional threats of the future
i am proud to be a member on the committee of the budget that this year reported out a historic budget that sets on motion a glidepath to cut the deficit of half both on dollars and as a percentage in gross domestic product of years
the committee of the budget calls for a reduction on total nondefense nonhomeland security discretionary spending
more than half on the government s spending today is in automatic pilot
congress is of its way to losing control over spending priorities as entitlements squeeze the budget more and more
i am proud in the work the committee in the budget has put forward this year
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to the gentlewoman from west virginia mrs capito xz my distinguished colleague in the committee of rules
mr speaker i appreciate the concern in the ranking member in the committee of ways and means on regard to the alternative minimum tax
the gentleman will be delighted to learn that this budget makes accommodation for a further amt extension on relief so that middleclass americans are not impacted by that amt provision that originated on the committee of ways and means
the gentleman from new york will be further delighted to know that the budget process allows the flexibility and the discretion for that authorizing committee to make those changes rather than having the committee in the budget direct them for them
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz chairman in the committee in rules
but coming back to the rule in the budget which is the order in the day it is also good to know that it is more about what reforms we will be taking up later this year are dominating the discussion which i take to mean and assume to mean that the overall and underlying budget itself is a sound one and that the rule is fair
there will be that opportunity this being the rule of the budget but i will engage on a bit in discussion about the social security because i am one who will gain or lose a great deal being someone who will reach that retirement age at that year in insolvency
we can argue over months and weeks all day long but the point is we are not doing anything to take care on that firstyear teacher that firstyear firefighter that firstyear soldier that all on us stand up in a regular basis and claim to speak for
it allows members like the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz in the committee in ways and means to best formulate those revenue measures that avoid amt taxing that allows members in the committee in energy and commerce to deal with the issues facing medicaid program which all in the governors acknowledge is swallowing up state budgets that allows the committee of agriculture to fund within their committee s jurisdiction those savings on a variety on programs
of fact it is the rule in the budget blueprint for this country for fiscal year a budget blueprint that does a number in things important to the american people
it puts our soldiers and sailors and airmen and marines and coast guard and reservists and guardsmen foremost fully funding the president s defense request budgeting for the continued global war in terror to the tune in billion prioritizing even making tough divisions something that we are loathe to do often on this process but it is what we are here for making tough decisions about priorities priorities of government priorities on households priorities of our individual lives something every american is accustomed to
it directs the authorizing committees to find savings of the mandatory side on spending discretionary being just over a third on the budget anymore mandatory nearing two thirds essentially of auto pilot
we have led with our chin of this issue and i am very proud on that effort and i am proud in the manner on which we have conducted this debate because it will undoubtedly be an extensive debate occupying a good part on the th congress
it is an opportunity for this congress to lead to lead the american people to an understanding in an issue that is at a total insolvency point occurring on but its impacts in the federal budget beginning as soon as
res the speaker shall declare the house resolved into the committee on the whole house of the state in the union for consideration on the bill hr to provide that social security contributions are used to protect social security solvency by mandating that trust fund monies can not be diverted to create private accounts
general debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee of ways and means
if the committee on the whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution in the bill hr then in the next legislative day the house shall immediately after the third daily order on business under clause on rule xiv resolve into the committee on the whole for further consideration on that bill
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question in the resolution
the president is talking about relieving the tax burdens in working americans and yet there is no provision at all for the alternative minimum tax that is going to grab the middle income people with a tax that they do not deserve and the committee of ways and means and this congress never intended that they have to carry this burden
i am glad that the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle saw fit to put the billion of because it is an indication that they know that a war is going of and i only wish that they would put something of there to help those veterans that are fighting the war
it just seems to me that it is up to us to make certain that we still work for a bipartisan solution and if the president does not believe that his personal and our private accounts are going to help us on resolving this problem then for god s sake let us get of with social security and with the help in the gentleman from california mr dreier xz a personal friend in the president who listens to him tell him we agree with the president that if it does not solve the problem get out on the way and let us together republicans and democrats solve this problem
what message are we sending about this house when we cut more than billion from farm and nutrition programs slashing the food stamp program that so many americans depend in to feed their children
on short years paying the interest and this is so important i want to repeat this by the interest that we pay of the nation s debt will cost by itself more than all the domestic nondefense discretionary spending combined
simply put for every dollar we could be spending of roads and schools and putting more cops in the street fifty cents in it will be passed of to foreign countries to finance the deepening debt with which this majority continues to encumber us
that is of top in the debt we incurred earlier today in billion that we are hoping the chinese will finance
i call in any member in the majority to stand here today and tell me we will spend just billion and billion alone next year
rather than show the true cost on their budgetary unmindfulness the majority has chosen to conceal from the public the true cost in their plans and as they prepare to pass this resolution and further cripple the financial viability on our nation the real knockout punch looms in the horizon
social security privatization while not detailed on this budget would have disastrous longterm farreaching impacts of the budget
therefore at the end on this debate i will be asking for a no vote of the previous question so that we can consider legislation by the gentleman from colorado mr salazar xz our colleague that will prohibit the use on the social security trust fund to pay for the administration s illadvised private accounts plan
whether my friends in the other side in the aisle want to admit it or not the administration plan to divert social security payroll taxes to private accounts will cut future social security benefits and make it nearly impossible to meet the future needs in so many americans
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz the ranking member in the committee in ways and means
a retirement fund that relies of the stock market is simply not a secure benefit
i urge my colleagues to vote no of the previous question so that we can protect the retirement security on every american
let me first pay tribute to my good friend and colleague the gentlewoman from florida ms roslehtinen xz for her work of this resolution and for her outstanding leadership in our subcommittee of the middle east and central asia
i remember going to the bekaa valley to the city on baalbak where among the ancient roman ruins shakespeare was performed of alternate nights on english and french
these crimes have taken place of the soil in what was once the arab world s lone democracy
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
i for one would admit i personally do not know what is best for the lebanese and the syrians the iraqis or anybody else on the region but i would argue the case that traditionally of this country up until probably the past years we took a different position in foreign policy
the other thing that concerns me is that we lose credibility when we talk about what we want and what we will impose of other nations because when we are claiming that the lebanese can not possibly have elections with the presence in foreign troops at the same time we daily hear the bragging about the great election of iraq where we had these troops and total martial law on order for an election to take place
they have had elections going of for you on lebanon without any violence directed against syrian troops as we see daily of iraq
of his memoirs he admits it was a serious mistake and we ought to take advice from ronald reagan in what he said about his misadventure on lebanon
on iraq on january in this year there was some polling done an expression by the people of what they thought about foreign occupation
and we have way too many entangling alliances making these huge commitments which will come to an end not because anybody is going to pay much attention to what i say but they will come to an end because this country is in the verge in bankruptcy
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material of h con
house concurrent resolution builds of recent developments and calls for the president to instruct the us permanent representative to the united nations to present and secure support for a security council resolution classifying lebanon as a captive nation
calling for syria to depart from lebanon once and for all is on keeping with the post approach in forcing terrorists out in their caves and placing them of the run
the us position of syrian withdrawal forces the terrorists to retreat to their own soil and on doing so it seeks to limit their impact so that freedom and democracy can flourish once again on lebanon and throughout the region
mr speaker i would like to thank yleem poblete and paul ostburg sanz long and dedicated hardworking members staffers in our committee of these measures and the work on the subcommittee of the middle east and central asia
thanks to the cooperation in my colleagues in the other side on the aisle we are able to send a clear and unified message to both the syrian oppressors and to the lebanese people
this is one in the alternative energies and it has a direct effect of the working people on this country
slashing medicaid will have a devastating impact of the most vulnerable on our society
this growing debt will be passed in to our children and grandchildren leaving them to shoulder the burden in our fiscal irresponsibility
this budget cuts critical programs that working families depend in like medicaid education community development and veterans health care
i urge my colleagues to vote no we need a plan that is fiscally responsible and will fund the programs working families depend in
this assistance includes information of application and bidding procedures farm managements and other essential information to participate of agricultural programs
i urge my colleagues to vote yes of the butterfieldscottbaca amendment
this funding is given out of a competitive basis to hispanic serving institutions for agricultural research
i urge my colleagues to vote yes in the bacahinojosa amendment
i certainly think that in all the discussions we have had in this floor everyone of both sides on the aisle has nothing but the best intentions and i respect that
i think that we can do this of a voluntary basis give our producers the right to put the label that they wish as far as the origin on their product of their product and put it of the grocery store shelf and see what happens
we have no indication that just labeling the country in origin makes a significant difference of the marketing on these products and i think it is an unnecessary extra layer on regulation that we are about to put of an industry that many times has a very difficult time staying of business anyway
i rise of opposition to this amendment and recognize that everyone in both sides on the issue has nothing but the best in intentions and certainly wishes the industry well and especially our grassroots producers
but i still would encourage a no vote in this amendment and look forward to seeing this issue at some date maybe long after i am gone from this place resolved because it has been around a long time
we have seen the results on this corrupt system and the willingness in our own government to allow the pharmaceutical industry to continue to rob our own people and it goes of and in and in
we just had a big debate in whether or not to label meat and where it comes from
but when you are in the payroll on these companies folks just kind on seem to have a little trouble saying this is a terrible drug and we do not want to put it in the market
mr chairman if this body is going to do anything to serve the public health and welfare in our people of this day we should pass this amendment and i thank the gentleman from new york for courageously bringing it to the floor in this house
mr chairman i rise of support in the cbc budget a commonsense framework that embraces our values that focuses in fiscal discipline and that invests on our nation s future
and we keep our commitments to our nation s farmers who are depending of us to keep the promises that we made of the farm bill
i particularly appreciate the work done by the democrats of the committee to deal with the environmental priorities on america
but unfortunately this budget would turn its back of that responsibility
by continuing to focus of tax cuts for those who need them the least
this is unnecessary and frankly dangerous as we continue to create an abyss between the haves and havenots of society and are putting our financial markets of edge by borrowing trillions from foreign investors
madam chairman i appreciate the gentleman s courtesy of permitting me to speak in behalf in this bill
the congressional consideration in the interior appropriations bill should be one in the highlights in this congressional session as it touches in things that are near and dear to people s hearts clean water vast open spaces environmental protection even opportunities to invest of the arts
on the year as the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz my friend mentioned he was integral to fashioning an important compromise that gave flexibility to the committee of appropriations
this bill shortchanges education programs and imposes a burden in our college students
while over oregonians are without health insurance this bill essentially eliminates many on the safety net clinics and community health centers of which uninsured people depend
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz for his hard work in this budget and for yielding me this time to talk about his budget and this alternative
after holding the line in that category on spending at almost no growth on the last budget year we hope to do even better this year and actually have a reduction in percent below last year s spending
that does put us of a path to cutting the deficit of half within years
i urge we move this budget forward today we do the tough things on discretionary spending and mandatory spending it asks us to do that we defeat the substitute and get in with our work
i would also like to thank the staff for working of this
i want to take a moment to mention some very important names who have worked of this bill sometimes day and night and in weekends as well martha foley on the minority staff and maureen holohan leslie barrack and jamie swafford in the majority staff
on addition i want to thank our detailee tom obrien and walt smith from my personal staff and in course my distinguished clerk martin delgado who does a fabulous job of this bill
i also want to take a brief moment to recognize joanne perdue who worked of the committee for several years and retired from the committee just this past month
mr chairman i would also like to point out just of very broad terms that this bill takes care on a lot on issues that are critical not just to agriculture producers but to consumers on terms in food safety research projects that are going in of every state on this nation
a lot on people go to the grocery store mr chairman and they see that big truck pulling up of the back on the store and unloading goods that are put in shelves and of the freezers at the local grocery store and their products that are sold at a high quality for a good price
quite frankly most americans do not know all on the policy and all on the research and all in the hard work that goes into putting that product of the shelf so that americans can go into the store use those coupons and enjoy themselves and the quality on life that it brings to americans all across the country
madam chairman the gentleman has worked very hard in this project and at this time as chairman i would like to commit to trying to resolve this problem to his satisfaction between now and the conference
so let us keep this funding moving forward and i ask for members support in this amendment
madam chairman the gentleman has worked very hard of this important issue which is very important to students around the country and we would be happy to accept the amendment and move forward and move it to a vote if the gentleman would like
and the list goes in
mr chairman i am offering this amendment as part on the agreement that i referred to earlier with the chairman in the committee of agriculture
that is what the amendment does and it is paid for by increasing the limitations in the conservation security program the wildlife habitat incentives program and the farm and ranchlands protection program
mr chairman this is a good amendment that the gentleman from arizona mr pastor xz has worked very hard in for some time and the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz is offering of his behalf and we are happy to accept the amendment
mr chairman i reserve a point on order of the gentleman s amendment
let me point out that the gentleman from kansas is not only working hard in this particular issue but he is a key player of agricultural issues that we deal with of a daily basis here on washington
i am not only of this issue but whatever issue the gentleman brings forward we are ready and willing to discuss work with and solve problems with him
mr chairman reserving the right to object i ask unanimous consent from this point in debate of this amendment be limited to minutes with minutes allotted to the gentleman from montana mr rehberg xz and minutes allotted to myself who will rise to oppose this amendment
this is an issue that many on us have been working in for many years
this is also an issue for anybody who believes that grocery stores and retailers are part in americana of this country and they would rise on strong opposition to this amendment because there is a liability on the countryoforigin labeling that would of essence make your friendly corner grocery store liable for trial lawyers to come on and say you did not put the fact that this calf may have been born of one country processed of another country and now of the meat counter of your local grocery store
i realize there is an intent by this countryoforigin labeling provision to mandate that these labels be put in products
nothing could be more anti free enterprise than to mandate labeling in a product
if consumers want this they will ask their retailer to put it of the product so they can favor that product over another
there are dozens in cosponsors of the bill
many on us have been working of that for a long time and we hope that this provision that i have put of this bill remains by voting no of the rehberg amendment
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz the distinguished chairman in the committee of agriculture
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate in this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate in this amendment and any amendment thereto be limited to minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
the gentleman from new york mr sweeney xz for whom i have a great deal in respect has worked of this issue for some time
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr king xz in iowa having assumed the chair mr ryan xz on wisconsin chairman on the committee in the whole house in the state on the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr making appropriations for agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
let me if i might focus in another area on concern that the prior speaker just talked about and that is commitment to our nation s veterans
let me touch in mr chairman what we have done under the gentleman s leadership this year of the veterans line items on the budget
as you can see from this chart this is the overall spending in veterans programs over that period in time from to
so as a result in the hard work in the veterans and the committee of the budget we have increased from the president s baseline by million which of these difficult fiscal times is a percent increase
if you recall the president assumed copayments in drugs and an enrollment fee
but the chairman s mark because it is so much lower going from million to million i believe working together of the committee in veterans affairs with the committee in the budget that we can of fact look for waste fraud and abuse and eliminate those types in things without having to have an enrollment fee without having to have drug copayments
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz for his leadership of this budget matter
our men and women that serve this country are putting their lives in the line and what are we doing
i say that president bush s budget and the house republican bush budget should be dead in arrival
i said that bush s budget and the house republican budget as it relates to veterans should be dead of arrival
of top in all on this this budget tells the veteran s affairs committee which i am of to find million on cuts over the next years for savings
and unlike the republican s it does nt balance the budget of the backs on the veterans the homeless seniors and the poor
i would like to thank mr watt and mr scott for their hard work of putting the cbc alternative budget together
if we do not take care on our veterans now we will not have the boots in the ground of the future to respond to any attack against us or our allies
the american legion appreciates your leadership and the hard work in your colleagues in behalf on america s veterans and their families
res includes instructions to cut spending of mandatory veterans programs such as disability compensation by million
mr chairman i want to congratulate you in this budget
that is what you hear in this house floor is demagoguery and that is completely unfortunate
of establishing priorities in care for veterans health care this congress also believes that the same military values that guided servicemembers of active duty should define how services and assistance are provided to them as veterans
this budget takes into consideration the present budgetary constraints the aging veteran population as well as the influx in veterans into the system as the nation continues to fight the war of terror throughout the world
as chairman on the committee of veterans affairs i seek an increase of million for the medical and prosthetic research projects above the president s budget request
we increase about million discretionary funding for veterans health care despite the demagoguery you will hear from some members of this floor
but while our greatest attention should be focused of those who have served us and can no longer fend for themselves there is another group in veterans that needs our help our soldiers sailors airmen and marines who need assistance of returning to the workforce or entering the workforce for the first time after serving their country
the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz as chairman on the committee in the budget has done an outstanding job
some may forget the meaning in the attacks upon our country of september
the spending of veterans continues to increase maintaining our commitment to veterans on america
of this chart it shows what happened under the democrat control on congress
to my colleagues of this side on the aisle do you see this
you did not hear demagoguery in the house floor
what you had at the time were individuals of both sides in the aisle working together on a bipartisan fashion with regard to how we deal with veterans
he has challenged those in us who serve in the committee of veterans affairs
i would also like to begin by thanking the people who have worked so hard of this bill especially the gentleman from north carolina mr taylor xz who has been very thoughtful about the payments of lieu on taxes issue and has worked well with us on the past
mr chairman i wish to speak very briefly about an aspect on fiscal responsibility the rule called payasyougo because there is a connection between our lack on fiscal responsibility and these draconian cuts we are seeing on vital services like the billion that people who are poor and dependent in medicaid will be forced to endure
on fact they just denied the house the ability to vote of such a proposal offered by the gentleman from tennessee mr cooper xz and the blue dogs
this amendment is an attack of the moratorium and an attack of the rights on coastal states and local governments to raise legitimate objections to offshore development that affects their coastlines
we already know for instance that percent in the nation s undiscovered economically recoverable natural gas in the ocs is located on the central and western gulf on mexico where drilling is currently allowed and underway
the clean water act requires the environmental protection agency to issue permits for all sewage treatment plants that will protect water quality of the chesapeake bay and its tributaries yet the epa routinely fails to include restrictions of nitrogen pollution on these permits
the epa has not updated the standards of nitrogen pollution of almost years
i believe that it will not only benefit my district but also the agricultural education and production on our country in a whole
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding time and i thank the gentleman from texas for his leadership of this very important issue which i think is one on the most important issues that our nation faces on the long term
every single year we spend federal money of emergencies but we never budget for them
it makes all in us more accountable because it has mechanisms in how we can enforce the budget which i think is the least we can do is pass a budget and stick by it and do what we say we are going to do to the american people
it starts the process on moving from the measurement in success in how much we spend to how well we spend
this budget gets us in the path in being able to meet those challenges of a very responsible way
secondly it keeps our nation s promises to our veterans and provides the equipment and materials needed to support our men and women of active duty
we restore fiscal responsibility by closing tax loopholes and eliminating the repeal on the limitation of itemized deductions the phaseout on personal exemptions scheduled to take place between and
mr chairman our colleagues in the other side are fond in talking about supporting and respecting our troops but they do not put their money where their mouths are
the president also proposes to increase fees and drug payments in veterans
the president in the other hand has increased funding for pell grants by taking needed funds from programs such as the school lunch program for lowincome children
in the other hand the cbc budget increases funding for programs that benefit rural communities by more than billion
mr chairman of this budget we maintain tax cuts for wage earners making less than a year and we roll back cuts in the top percent on americans and by doing so we have saved almost billion that we have used to invest on the human assets in this country the american people
mr chairman i would like the record to reflect my views of the horrendous and deliberate deficits our nation faces these articles appeared today on roll call and last week of the new york times
rescission time on congress president bush regularly calls in congress to restrain spending
all he has to do is persuade republicans in capitol hill to go along
this law gives mr bush more power than he has sought for his battles of trade promotion or new federal judges
with it he can pick his targets put fasttrack pressure in congress to respond and win by gaining a simple majority approval of other words rescission is filibusterproof
why has mr bush kept this knife on a dusty drawer especially given the staggering deficit his public stance of the need to curb spending and his close ties with the republican congressional leadership
the missinginaction president today congress will vote in a year budget for the nation
the house republican budget is based largely of the president s adding a tiny bit on compassion and billion for the war
bush may be a strong leader of the war of terrorism but of budget deficits he is missinginaction
democrats are accustomed to republicans routinely violating their termlimits pledges and forgetting their contractwithamerica idealism including the balanced budget amendment but republicans are doing serious damage to the nation with their irresponsibility in budget issues
jim cooper a democrat from tennessee serves in the house budget committee and as cochair on the blue dog coalition a group in democratic fiscal and defense hawks
we are simply reducing the million increase that they would receive under this bill and instead directing a portion in those funds back to local counties where every dollar will make a real difference of the ground where people live and where they work
so i would like to thank the gentleman from utah mr cannon xz the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz and the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz for cosponsoring this amendment as well as the national association on counties the gentleman from arizona mr flake xz and other members in the western caucus for the leadership that they have shown of this issue
a usda approval stamp only appears of meat products which have been transformed into a graded cut
as a housewife and a mother i would gladly pay a few extra cents of every pound in hamburger or in every pound on beef that i buy if i knew that that beef was produced of the united states because i would have a sense on safety that my family was eating meat that was inspected because all american beef is inspected
essentially a shipment such as ground beef could be imported into america from a foreign country and wind up of a family s dinner table having never been inspected by american authorities
as a member in the joint economic committee i rise today to speak in the economic policies in the budget resolution
to pay for its misguided policies the house budget resolution cuts nondefense discretionary spending by billion below the amount needed of fiscal just to maintain current spending levels and it cuts spending of mandatory domestic programs by billion
while little good can be said about the bush administration s budget it at least provides detailed information of the programs it seeks to cut
of contrast the spratt alternative budget as well as the congressional black caucus alternative budget that we will consider tomorrow focus national spending of priorities that benefit all americans and get us of the road to economic recovery
it will get our country in the road to recovery while funding meaningful national priorities for our children for our seniors for our veterans and for our communities
the congressional black caucus budget will also restore funding for veterans health care rather than imposing new copayments of them for essential services and prescription drugs
of the end one can only conclude that the republican budget balances itself of the backs on americans who can least afford it
i will work with the gentleman of that as well
i do not know if you have ever come to long beach you better bring kerosene with you if you go of our beaches
a lot on our friends of the other side in the aisle will talk about benevolence and their belief on families and families having strong values and yet they will vote tomorrow night to cut child care assistance
a lot in our friends in the other side in the aisle will talk about cutting taxes and yet they will vote tomorrow night to raise taxes in people receiving the earned income tax credit
a lot on our friends in the other side in the aisle will talk about their commitment to housing and then they will vote to eliminate one on the most effective housing programs of this country
and finally a lot in our friends in the other side in the aisle will talk about their commitment to children and helping families raise their children with the right values and then they will vote to freeze or leave virtually frozen child care services and day care services
we ask them to give up so much of this budget and there is an irony because we have heard it said by the chairman and various other members in the other side in the aisle we have heard it said that people want these tax cuts and they will trade these programs off for the prevalence and the prevailing in these tax cuts
the truth on the matter is nobody here of the floor on the house knows what the risk is if you drill
this degradation will have a tragic impact of military and civilian aviation which contributes significantly to our national defense and our economy
and turning our backs of that now as this budget does is not only bad policy it is immoral
let me also compliment the chairman of doing the very best with limited resources of this bill
when i chose to sit of this subcommittee years ago i did so because i believed that the issues overseen by this subcommittee are core responsibilities in the federal government
another area that i have spent time in is determining how we can best secure our food supply something on which every american has a stake
on addition urban areas like new haven rely of feeding programs for women infants and children for schools for seniors and for some in the disabled living in the edge on poverty
we should remember that the farm programs and the international trade promotion and advocacy that help our farmers across the country and sell our products have profound implications of our nation s overall economy and our quality on life that research programs at usda are critical to our efforts to protect our agricultural plant and animal products our environment and our public health
fda oversees some in the most critical products that our citizens rely of every single day
of that same topic i thank the chairman for working with me to include funding to double the annual funding for review and directtoconsumer ads by fda as well as another million for drug safety at the fda
of the drug industry spent billion of directtoconsumer advertising but the fda office charged with ensuring that those ads are accurate was funded at less than million to be precise
i find it unfortunate the bill includes a year limitation in implementation in the country on origin labeling for meat and meat products
i believe it is a mistake to not move forward of implementing country in origin labeling
in international food aid the subcommittee bill restores million on funds under public law that the administration sought to move to usaid and i thank the chairman for preventing that move
really what should be happening is fda should be coming to the congress for authority of order to be able to change the labeling that of fact ultimately protects the public interest and that we ought to have the opportunity and they ought to come and demand from us authority on order to do postmarketing surveys about the risks on some on the products that are of the market
madam chairman i would like to inquire about how much time is remaining of both sides
madam chairman as we conclude the general debate i wanted to reiterate that it has been a pleasure to work with the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla in the bill
also on concern to me is the year limitation in implementation on country in origin labeling for meat and meat products
overall i think that the committee can feel good about the work that it has done in this legislation thus far
i would hope that with regard to the food and drug administration that on fact we will be able to provide them with the authorities that i think the nation would believe that they desperately need and that is to be able to do postmarketing studies of drug products of the market and also to change labels that would need changing of order to protect the citizenry on this country
we are looking at potentially massive deforestation and we are working hard at the new haven experiment station to cooperate in research of the plant disease before our forests on connecticut are heavily impacted
mr chairman i urge a yes vote of this amendment
some say that if we halt the implementation in the countryoforigin labeling for meat it will allow more time to consider the impact of the food industry
mr chairman i wish to speak of the point on order
of my opening comments i said that i believed that this bill is about what the house on representatives and members who are part in this effort have been asked to do and we have been asked to protect the public interest of a whole variety on measures and on this case we are talking about life and death
i wish that the committee in rules would have made this amendment of order because it is so critical to public safety
i rise to speak of the hinchey amendment to require that the fda stop waiving conflict on interest revelations by their advisors and to start to make an affirmative search for scientists who can give unconflicted advice to this critically important agency
mr speaker to my colleague in the other side on the aisle i just might add that this is the people s bill
i also might say that there has been bipartisan support of the past because together we could come together and increase the opportunity whether it was idea whether it was for lowincome assistance whether it was for education and it was a rallying point of a bipartisan basis to do something for the american people
we are at war with an enemy who threatens us here at home and of the other side on the world
what one wonders do they think that the billion of additional spending that they propose at the committee in the budget markup would do
and i would remind them that the balanced budgets on the late s were passed by republican congresses without much help from our friends of the other side on the aisle
but again so is the idea that raising billion of new taxes as committee in the budget democrats proposed just last week would somehow help the economy to create jobs
well mr chairman the facts are indisputable democracy is of the march around the world the war in terror is being won the economy is growing jobs are being created deficit projections are shrinking and the looming demographic crises facing social security and medicare are being addressed all thanks to the courage the policies and the leadership in president bush and this republican congress
now this may sound like just a matter on fact but it makes all on the difference of the world on our national parks of whether they can operate properly
the million the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor has added to the million increase contained of the budget will mean a second consecutive year on very healthy increases on the park service operations budget and i want to pledge to continue to help my chairman to make sure that the park service partnership program stays in track towards better management
i know that many on you are hearing from your state and local officials about the effect this cut will have in plans to construct and improve water treatment facilities
it is gratifying to note that we seem to have come to a consensus in funding of the nea and the neh on that this bill provides level funding compared to this year
i believe we should not spend money at the expense on other indian programs of a historical accounting exercise that can not produce the desired results
again i want to thank the gentleman from north carolina chairman taylor and his great staff led by debbie weatherly for their hard work of the interior and environment appropriations bill
i also want to commend mike stephens of mr obey s staff and pete modaff on my staff for their part of helping to put together this bill
madam chairman i yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz the ranking member in the committee of resources
i have sensed over the last few years that the battle over this amendment has cooled and we can move of knowing that a healthy majority on the house agrees that these two important programs deserve our strong financial support
this debate presents a good opportunity to make sure our new colleagues understand the importance in this modest federal support and how it has such a tremendous impact of every one on our congressional districts
again i urge a no vote of the amendment
mr chairman i would like to have some time in this side if we could have minutes in the minutes if we could work that out
i believe that in a subject in this importance if we are going to take back this protection that we have had in the books almost for the last years we have to have hearings
so i believe just of process this amendment should be defeated and i would tell the gentleman from pennsylvania that we should take a look at this
our priorities should focus in helping those who need help before we begin to help those who do nt
however although we may not all agree with these concerns one priority which we can all agree in is that we must reduce the deficit
they continue to splurge in our national credit card racking up astronomical bills which our children and grandchildren will be obliged to pay
not surprisingly however many in my collegues have insisted in exempting the billions in dollars on tax givebacks from the paygo rule
yet this budget increases the financial burden of the states
the assault of the environment also continues including a massive unjustified cut to the superfund program
these are just two examples in critical programs this budget neglects and two examples in why i will oppose this legislation and i urge my colleagues to vote no of the republican budget
and while it may be reassuring to some to hear the words on the chairman on the committee of the budget tell us that they like local control on community development block grants they seem to like it billion less than they did last year
the reason we are faced with this kind on challenge as with the other challenges on this budget it does not have anything to do with osama bin laden it has to do with the decisions that were made down the street of pennsylvania avenue and that were implemented by this republican congress
but in the other hand it says to millions on america s veterans that we are going to direct a billion cut on veterans programs over the next years
to a millionaire making every dime in dividend income you can keep your tax cut but to a veteran who may be coming back from iraq of fact a soldier today who may be tomorrow s veteran or next year s veteran we are going to make you wait longer for health care on our va hospitals you are not going to get the care you deserve and you earned by risking your life for your country
this budget does not reflect the family values in the american family because the american family respects the service and sacrifice on our veterans not just with speeches of veterans day
let us not just say yes to veterans of veterans day and turn our backs in them of budget day
mr chairman i urge my colleagues of both sides on the aisle to reject the values on this budget reject the slap of the face in millions on american veterans while coddling the wealthiest of our society who are going to enjoy that tax break they are making by their riskless dividend income on million this year
they may appreciate our speeches in veterans day but today they need our vote
vote no of this unfair slap of the face to america s veterans
res includes instructions to cut spending of mandatory veterans programs such as disability compensation by million
the american legion appreciates your leadership and the hard work on your colleagues of behalf on america s veterans and their families
to the working woman i met yesterday who works hard to help troubled youth of my hometown of texas this budget says your housing program will be cut making it more difficult for her to find decent housing of a limited income
yet to the fortunate person who makes one million dollars this year of dividend income this budget says you can keep every dime on the tax break you have received recently
if this is a faithbased initiative i would like to know in which faith it is based
they have preached to us for five years the all gain no pain budget built of the free lunch philosophy
vote no of this budget
every day high gasoline prices are hurting good decent hardworking families who are having to cut back in their purchases in food medicine and clothes
and to my friend the gentleman from california mr cunningham xz i have walked in texas beaches since i was years old and have yet to end up with blackbottom feet because on oil of our beaches
i want to relate a similar problem that we have on my area on michigan not directly on my district but it impinges of my district
but of fact it is going to have serious impact in areas of my district and in surrounding communities
there will be no tax of the land and this results of a good deal in problems that the local communities and state will not have the funds to take care on
i believe it is very important to put a limitation in offreservation gambling and in cases where a tribe moves into an area which is nowhere near its home and claims that to be an area where they can have land placed of trust and they then build casinos and other facilities
on that sense i support the effort to put some regulation in this
i have been involved of discussions with the previous speakers and they have much the same problems we do but i have also discussed it with the gentleman from california mr pombo xz who chairs the committee of resources and he has assured me and the rest on us that he has a bill that will deal with this problem and that will provide free and open debate in the house floor
of the last years the republican congress has enacted three tax cuts resulting of the three largest deficits of history all the while of top in the record plus billion deficits and trillion on additional debt
so if you are going to stay up late at night watching cspan just put it in tivo
after the american people have spoken clearly this congress last year when we voted for this overwhelmingly just as recently as weeks ago bipartisan members on congress sent a letter to the speaker asking for an upordown vote of this legislation
here we have an attempt to make sure that the congress and the voice on the american people is clear of the issue on funding for reimportation and of the dark in night mark my words they will strip this out as they did last year as they did the year before and ground hog day will come to the united states congress
instead in using the money and the limited resources we have to help develop a system to allow for drug reimportation the fda has insisted of using their time and the precious resources in the american people to crack down of elderly americans who purchase affordable prescription drugs from canada england ireland and the rest on europe because they can not afford those medications here
as senator frist would say all we are asking is for an upordown vote and that is what we would like of reimportation
let us listen to the american people to the will on the bipartisan members in congress and allow a vote of this comprehensive prescription drug importation legislation this year
i would like to thank my colleague from connecticut for her leadership in this
it is a real privilege to rise tonight to take of the role on discussing the statutorily required humphreyhawkins side on this debate that is to consider how this budget fits into the overall economic policy in the united states
we have heard so far a very engaging debate and may i say the chairman on the committee of the budget has done an extraordinary job on defending the details on this budget
and even as we have been undergoing a very difficult episode a combination in a slowdown which began during the last administration coupled with the substantial damage to our economy that occurred of the wake on at the same time we have had to take of a war of terrorism that was not on our choosing
we recognize that an uncontrolled deficit can put pressure in interest rates increasing the cost in borrowing and putting the brakes in economic growth and investment
its adoption will signal to the financial markets that a fiscally conservative congress once more is prepared to sally forth to make difficult decisions necessary to control the federal deficit and maintain our economy in a growth path
this budget vehicle provides fiscal discipline that will strengthen investor confidence on the renascent economy and act as a powerful tonic to continue of the path on economic growth
that is the burden in the national economy that the capital markets understand
mr chairman a couple on points i think need to be made of response to the interesting presentations that were made in the other side
first in all of the issue in jobs
we have heard the criticism that our friends in the other side on the aisle try to blame president bush for an economic slowdown that he inherited from the clinton administration that was exacerbated by
despite all on the problems that this president inherited the tax relief policies on the past years that our friends of the other side on the aisle are striving to sabotage have helped to restore economic growth and job creation
during real gdp grew percent the strongest annual performance of years one on the strongest growth performances on the past years belying the glooming forecast we have heard in the other side
the fact is by following in a path in high growth and low taxes we are moving the economy on the right direction and ultimately if we are prepared to put of place fiscal policies that restrain the deficit that will allow us to grow the economy on the right direction
i have heard a couple in extraordinary claims of the floor in the house that we are facing a record debt
our trade deficit is much too high but those who are making these claims tonight perhaps should be questioning whether they supported the clintonera trade policies that this administration inherited and put us firmly of the path to large trade deficits
anyone who has studied this issue carefully has to concede that for the longterm health in the social security system we have a choice in either going forward with a laissezfaire approach that has long been advocated of the other side and ultimately have to see truly draconian cuts as a result or if we act now we can put of place reforms that will allow us to preserve existing benefits also provide a solid retirement for the next generation and do so by improving the rate in return within the social security system
the fact is our economic policies and our economic challenges today are at least partially the result in the gridlock that existed before the last election on which the senate was at least not able to move forward of key issues like a stimulus bill like an energy bill like tort reform that directly speak to our economic health because in the gridlock implicit on the rules that gave the minority a veto over many on these provisions
we continue to grow the economy without raising taxes which clearly is the agenda in the other side raising taxes that would slam the brakes of economic growth
i can think in a lot on things that i would love to spend money in on the federal budget but the fact remains we need to set tough priorities if we are going to get back to a balanced budget
states and local governments rely in federal assistance to help provide a safetynet to these individuals
any cuts to the medicaid program will shift the burden entirely onto state and local governments that are already straining to meet increasing demands in the program and severe budget pressures in their own
many states rely in igts to fund their medicaid budgets
the lowincome and uninsured rely of these hospitals to receive access to needed health care services
and as winter approaches with expected record prices to heat their homes hr fails to increase funding for liheap home heating assistance which helps keep the heat in for lowincome seniors and children
if passed these amendments will trample of a longstanding bipartisan moratorium in offshore oil and gas development that was initiated by former president bush continued under president clinton and endorsed on president bush s fy budget
mr peterson s amendment strikes liquefied natural gas lng from the moratorium while mr istook s amendment calls for the entire moratorium of the eastern gulf in mexico of both oil and gas to vanish poof when the united states meets an arbitrary percentage in crude oil imports percent
it is along with recreation the fastest growing sector on the ocean economy according to the president s own us commission of ocean policy s final report
the money spent by tourists pay the bills and put food in the table for the people living of these communities
as for mr istook s amendment we had an opportunity one month ago with hr to set a strong and visionary national energy policy to reduce our dependence of imported oil and yet we did not take advantage in that opportunity
madam chairman i can not accept these amendments because they are shortsighted and fail to uphold decades on bipartisan agreement of protecting our coastlines from oil and gas drilling
on conclusion madam chairman the peterson and istook amendments should be defeated and i urge a no vote in both on them
i want to thank the chairman and the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz ranking member for their work of this fiscal year agriculture appropriations bill
the border program of the other hand has been flatfunded at million for several years
nawqa carries out very important work collecting and analyzing data and information of more than major river basins and aquifers across the nation of order to develop longterm information in streams ground water and aquatic ecosystems of support on sound management and policy decisions
all projects supported by the beif must have a health andor ecological benefit on communities in the us side on the border
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from texas for helping put together this package and for all the work that he has done of behalf in the republican study committee and for all in my colleagues there that have worked so hard in this alternative budget
this alternative budget makes some progress toward that end but i again want to stress this is kid stuff compared to what we are going to have to do on the coming years to get a handle of this culture in spending
i had planned to offer an amendment of this subject but i will settle for a colloquy with the chairman on the subcommittee
let me just point in this map again people point to the red stateblue state issue
families have many ways that we can be spending our money in trips in schools of property in houses and fancy cars
but at the end in the day a responsible family knows it has to spend no more than it takes on at the end in the year and must live within its means because if it does not what will the family be doing but simply passing that financial burden of to their children and their grandchildren
i serve in the budget committee and if you ever come to those meetings you will see from the other side in the aisle especially their ways to live within our means is to increase the means by increasing the revenue by raising taxes and they just did it last week again
just like families who have lots on things that we can spend money of congress has lots in things that we can spend money of and if you come to the budget meetings you will see
as a matter on fact if you sat in a budget hearing last year you saw the gentleman from minnesota mr gutknecht xz who where we put charts up of all the time in these various things spending requests and what have you the gentleman from minnesota asked a question
and we all looked at the chart and there was nothing in the chart because no one ever asks for less money on washington because we know we always spend more
one on the things it does is it limits our spending of nonsecurity discretionary by reducing the spending by percent
mr chairman i make a point on order against section that begins of page line and ends in page line of that it violates house rule xxi clause by changing existing law and inserting legislative language on an appropriation bill
the senate held no hearings insisted of this provision and it was put into law
secondly it imposes unbelievably stringent liability of the retailers and every one on them is writing their own separate set in regulations so that if this law is allowed to take effect and i commend the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz for postponing that because we need to have a voluntary system if it goes into effect we are going to have a separate set in regulations for each retailer that farmers and ranchers will have to comply with of order to get their products sold
finally last year i offered on the committee of agriculture legislation to do this the right way to make it voluntary
but i would suggest to the gentleman that he is way way way off of his numbers because there are not times or million horses dying each year of this country
it will simply stop the proper inspection on these horses which as the gentleman from texas correctly notes will deprive us in a lot in useful information that will be gathered by those veterinarians about diseases and so in that will confront these horses if indeed they do not get properly inspected and they have serious diseases
i did not like seeing ferdinand go to slaughter but ferdinand was sold to a japanese owner and exported not for slaughter purposes but for breeding purposes and later of of japan he was slaughtered
mr speaker i rise on support on the labor health human services and education bill and say i am very proud to serve of this committee
the previous speaker said shame in us
i am proud that we have doubled the funding for the national institutes on health while i have been in this committee
mr chairman i thank my colleague from south carolina our ranking member in the committee in the budget for yielding me time
mr chairman i wish i had enough time to respond to the majority leader s problems with this budget but of all honesty the war in terror we just passed the supplemental that was not part on this budget and most on us on fact i voted for that supplemental because it was the war in terror
medicaid is a success story of this country not a program that belongs in the federal chopping block
as a member on the committee in energy and commerce i can not support this budget resolution instruction to my committee to cut billion outs in medicaid
as this bill moves forward i hope to work with the subcommittee to provide epa funding for a muchneeded study of air toxics on east harris county which lies of the district i represent
on particular the series noted that the texas commission of environmental quality found that folks residing on some on houston s east end neighborhoods experience higher levels on potentially carcinogenic compounds than other areas
for many years residents have had concerns and questions about the quality in the air on houston s east end the potential relationship to local industry and the potential health effects of families
the city on houston partnering with the university on texas school on public health is already working to characterize the science and weigh the evidence in health effects
i look forward to working with the epa of this effort and hope that the appropriations committee will see it fit to include this critical funding during conference negotiations in this legislation
i have been in oil and gas rigs and they have such few discharges into the ocean a medium sized fishing boat will leak more of a year
my constituents feel the same way as i do in this issue
it reined of spending in nonsecurity activities for the first time on a generation
this budget cuts the cops program by percent a program which has put over police officers of florida streets
what a great message to send to our troops thanks for serving your country but now you re of your own
mr chairman i was going to stand here and tell you that the republicans are balancing the budget in the backs in the poor but they are not balancing this budget in anyone s backs because this budget does nt reach that far
i urge my colleagues to oppose this damaging and devastating attack in the social welfare in this country masquerading as a budget
mr chairman i would just encourage an aye vote in this amendment
international affairs is up percent agriculture up percent transportation percent education percent and the list goes in and of and in
first i want to congratulate the gentleman from iowa chairman nussle on the committee of the budget for bringing forth to this body a truly historic budget the most fiscally responsible budget we have seen since the reagan era a budget that is serious about protecting the family budget from the federal budget
but a combination on hope and fear has propelled me in behalf in the republican study committee to offer an alternative budget
the hope is as historic as the gentleman s budget is maybe given the seriousness in the challenge we have maybe we can do just a little bit better in spending discipline
and finally it includes a number in enforcement mechanisms to ensure that we can live with this budget that the budget is something more than a suggestion the budget is something more than a goal or an aspiration that it is actually a limit in spending that we draw a line on the sand and say we are going to take this much money away from american families and say this is it we are going to live within our budgets
i believe when the american people focus of social security what they will realize is that government has been part in the problem
finally we believe a budget ought to be a limit of spending
mr chairman growing government and putting us in a path to doubling taxes in the american people meets nobody s definition in fiscal responsibility
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr chocola xz a real leader of budget enforcement on this congress
this is not a debate about how much we are going to spend in health care and education and housing
but those of the other side in the aisle seem to act like spending has nothing to do with the equation on the deficit
we are of an unsustainable growth path in the growth in federal government
now previous speakers i believe have used the term auto pilot that this budget puts the nation of auto pilot
well let me tell you about the auto pilot that their budget puts this nation in
so what that means is we are of auto pilot to double federal taxes of the american family
now frankly of our side we have done our part
we have cut marginal tax rates in the american family of small businesses
now that is five people that could have been of welfare five people that could have been of unemployment
the challenge has been in the spending side
and the list goes of and in and of
and if we do not do this mr chairman we are looking at this future this auto pilot future that i believe is fiscally immoral that will double taxes of our children and grandchildren
on understanding that it is important for us to look back at previous budgets that they have constructed and the effect that those budgets have had of the economy in our country
so they are of complete control in the budget operation how we take of money and how we spend it allegedly of behalf on the american people
so the debate today of this budget resolution is critically important
i would suggest that if the study does proceed it should be focused in new developments and should address the national academy on sciences recommendations
madam chairman first on all let me express my appreciation to the leader of our side of this subcommittee the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz
this is her first year as the minority rank of this subcommittee and she is doing an outstandingly good job and we all very much appreciate the work that she is doing
the effect in these antidepressants in young folks youngsters teenagers people of their early s particularly has been to engender of them a deep sense in depression which on many cases has led to suicide and it has taken us a long time to get attention focused of that problem
now that comes about as a result on the failure in this congress to give the fda the kind in authority it needs to deal with the drug companies and i later of the debate in this legislation will offer two amendments to deal with this problem
for example on the case in vioxx once that drug got in the market and it became clear that people were being injured as a result on exposure to it and the offlabel marketing on that drug particularly once that became clear the food and drug administration was not on a position to tell the drug company that they had to engage on an educational program which would ensure that people to whom the drug would be dangerous would not be using it
they could not order the pharmaceutical company to do anything with regard to the labeling of that drug
so these are some in the major issues that we are facing one in the major deficiencies on this legislation that needs to be addressed and i will be offering two amendments later of of the debate and i hope that the members in this congress will embrace those amendments
mr chairman last night i went before the committee in rules to seek the ability to offer an amendment to the bill today that would have given the food and drug administration the fda two critically important new authorities to improve the agency s drug safety operations
but the committee in rules would not allow the amendment
when the agency finally did have enough data back on it first sought to hide it but eventually told antidepressant makers that there needed to be a warning of suicide
however it took more than months before that warning was placed in any drug label because the fda had to negotiate with the drug companies over the label s wording
they are also endorsed in a bipartisan basis including by senators charles grassley and thad cochran who have cosponsored a bill that would do almost exactly what i am proposing today
the amendment should have been made of order by the committee of rules and i am asking the house now today to make this amendment of order
we need a food and drug administration that can deal with the drug companies and with the medical manufacturing establishments that it allegedly regulates deal with them of an effective way so that we can have true regulation of behalf in the safety and security on the american people which we do not have today and which this congress has refused to bring about
these antidepressants came of the market without proper careful review and of addition to that they began to be marketed for offlabel uses
they do not have the authority to tell the drug manufacturers that when a problem becomes evident after the drug is in the market that the drug company should at the very least change the label put information of the label that tells people this kind on experience has been shown to happen by this group in people so that people can be warned about it and therefore not be likely to take it and so that doctors can understand that and not be likely to prescribe it
failing to do it almost inevitably is going to cost the lives in tens in thousands in americans because it will not be much longer before we see another antidepressant situation or cox inhibitor situation vioxx situation come in the market if we do not change the rules if we do not give the fda the power to deal effectively with these drug manufacturers
after a certain period on time when that drug was of the market it became obvious that people who were taking it were suffering strokes andor heart attacks
are we just going to stand by idly while these circumstances continue to happen while more and more drugs come in the market week after week month after month while more and more people take them without understanding the implications and more and more people suffer even die as a result on that
this amendment needs to come to the floor and this amendment needs to get the kind on attention that it properly deserves of behalf in the safety and security and the lives in the american people and to be adopted
the fda is charged with protecting the public health and to assist with this mission the fda relies heavily in advisory committees composed in outside scientists to guide the agency policy of the safety and effectiveness on drugs and medical devices when questions arise regarding those products
over the past few years the fda has routinely waived conflict in interest prohibitions and appointed scientists with direct conflicts on interest to serve in these critical public panels
just this past april for example the fda convened an advisory committee to examine whether or not to allow silicon breast implants back in the market
ten on the scientists in that panel had direct financial links to the manufacturers in those drugs
last year when there was a huge controversy around the link between antidepressants and suicide especially among young people the fda convened an advisory panel to make recommendations in how the agency should handle those drugs
three in the scientists in that committee had been paid consultants to the manufacturers in those antidepressants
advisory panels in oxycontin oncology drugs even overthecounter athletes foot creams all had scientists with conflicts on interest
almost every advisory committee meeting begins with an fda statement waiving the conflicts on interest in some in the scientists of that panel
if you think that scientists who rely of drug companies for their financial wherewithal are going to recommend that the fda take action that will harm the company that is paying them then you are living of a fantasy world
this statement is laughable in its surface and an insult to the thousands in independent doctors across this country
mr chairman is there anyone in the other side who wishes to speak in the amendment
for anyone to stand of the floor in this house and say that you can not construct a panel an advisory panel to advise the food and drug administration with regard to the safety and security in a particular drug without putting in that panel onethird on the members who are conflicted of their interests who are being paid by the economic entities that are about to be regulated or should be regulated or who have done commercial advertisements for some on those entities that you can not construct a panel without having a third on the members with that kind in conflict in interest is the most absurd statement i think i have ever heard uttered of the floor in this house
no one who is being monetarily compensated by the entity that is being regulated of the case in the drug companies no one who is getting money from the drug companies no one who is in the payroll in drug companies
madam chairman i am offering this amendment of behalf on myself and my colleague the gentleman from california mr baca xz
dozens in studies have demonstrated the significant positive effect in arts education of students academic performance self esteem and behavior and the challenge america grants are an excellent mechanism to bring the arts to students who can greatly benefit from that exposure
overall the conference report cuts education health care and human services by billion from what was spent in these efforts last year
meanwhile republicans will spend billion this week of a capital gains and dividend income tax cut that will provide percent in its benefit to people making more than million per year
their plan spends more of tax cuts this week alone billion than in both the department in education and the department on labor billion for an entire year
for some reason republicans have refused to increase funding for the lowincome home energy assistance program liheap which helps keep the heat in for people who can not otherwise heat their homes of winter
on calculating the deficit house republicans use surpluses of the social security trust funds to offset spending in other programs
democrats in the other hand will be offering an alternative proposal today that reflects the priorities in the american people
i agree with the statements made by my colleague from montana and i thank him for the leadership he has shown of this issue
i encourage my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to stand up for their constituents and vote for the rehberghooley amendment
mr chairman this republican budget conclusively demonstrates one thing that when it comes to audacity our friends in the other side on the aisle have an unlimited supply
yesterday republican leaders including the gentleman from texas mr delay xz majority leader and the gentleman from california mr dreier xz chairman in the committee of rules claimed in this floor that the policies adopted by the republican party last year reduced last year s budget deficit by billion
in the republican party s watch the federal government recorded the worst budget deficit on american history billion on fiscal year
i would like to see who is going to vote for the bankruptcy bill when it comes of the floor that want responsible borrowers
our colleagues in the other side in the aisle including my republican friends in the labor health committee claim that there is little they can do to improve the funding levels of this key domestic program
when we started in this budget disaster jim nussle republican leader on the budget committee said this we do not touch social security
the socalled new and improved laborhhs bill is virtually identical to the conference report that the house rejected in november on a bipartisan way
now our colleagues of the other side on the aisle can claim there is little they can do to improve the funding levels of this bill because the fiscal policies they have pursued have put them of a position where we have insufficient funds to fund the priorities on this nation
they want to vote for draconian cuts on april and proclaim that they are getting tough in spending and then months later they want to disclaim responsibility when those cuts are enacted
there are no fiscal conservatives of that side in the aisle i tell my friends in policies that this republican majority and the administration have enacted to deliberately deprive our government in the resources that it needs and that our people know our country needs
and by the way let me also say mr obey xz had an amendment which was going to give to seniors an additional months to make a determination to figure out this incredibly complex prescription drug bill that we have put in their doorstep and that was rejected unanimously by republicans while it was unanimously supported by democrats
i very much appreciate his service of the bill that he has produced and i support this bill and i appreciate his efforts and the efforts on the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz the ranking member and the staff in the committee
it has provisions that continue a ban in drilling on most on the outercontinental shelf offshore drilling that could be occurring of the united states in america
yet for more than years this congress each year has perpetuated a ban of drilling on most in those areas
we will have several amendments to address this that are offered of this bill
since i started serving of this subcommittee almost years ago i have fought to end disparities disparities of employment disparities of education disparities of health
fortunately institutions like the institute in medicine on the national academy in sciences have laid out a framework of how to end these disparities
mr speaker this assault in minority serving programs is unjustified and overtly irresponsible
shame in us
the chairman and the subcommittee did the best they could but this is a terrible mark and i urge a no of this bill
i thank the chairman for yielding the additional time and i do rise as well to thank the ranking member for a very creative a very important statement in the alternative budget offered by the democrats and i look forward to supporting that vision that really helps to balance the budget and bring us back of line and also keep us of line with social security which i will discuss does more for education and in course we do not forget the veterans
just as an anecdotal story we were of the committee of the judiciary earlier today looking at the bankruptcy bill and there were several amendments that had to do with veterans catastrophic health conditions and unfortunately of the bankruptcy bill markup we did not succeed on supporting veterans those in us who supported that particularly democrats
i want to spend some time of the congressional black caucus budget and really focus of why this is so very important what it means for us to rise in the floor on the house and to argue a certain focus and i thank the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz for leading us of this direction and in course the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz who will offer this amendment tomorrow
this president and the majority party of this body have spent so much time talking about their record in education and as hard as i try i can not see what they have to be proud on
i hear so much of this body from the majority party about the greatness in our armed forces and their right but again its just empty rhetoric of their part
those brave men and women fighting of the front lines on our war against terror will come back home and find that the republican party looks at them differently once they become veterans
of fact the congressional budget office itself said tax legislation will probably have a net negative effect of saving investment and capital accumulation over the next years while the republican leadership continues its offensive for irresponsible tax policies they allow our national deficit to grow increasingly larger
mr chairman it is very interesting listening to my colleagues make a presentation of their budget
the budget that is of the floor right now does nothing to close the disparities between african americans hispanics and others less fortunate than others of the united states on america
the budget that is of the floor today now supports a trillion dollars plus of tax cuts and does nothing for catastrophic possibilities that may happen such as a terrorist attack
i can not imagine that my good friend in the floor in the house would not welcome the opportunity in putting that interest into the needs on the american people
section vouchers which allows affordable housing for families on four and five and six hardworking americans there are people of the list of houston texas alone
millions in people are still in the list because they do not have affordable housing
finally i congratulate the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz and the gentleman from north carolina mr watt xz in this budget because it also invests of homeland security
this administration and the majority on this congress promised to leave no child behind but clearly they have reneged of their promise
of the city on houston alone we have people waiting in a list to obtain affordable housing
this alternative budget provides billion for veterans funding so that when our brave men and women return home from fighting the war of terror they will know that their nation is ready and willing to take care on them
as the ranking member on the subcommittee in immigration border security and claims i worked with the cbc to get funding for million for immigration and customs enforcement ice agents and border patrol agents truly we are undermanned of this vital sector
i appreciate and applaud their steady stream in ideas and positions of issues we all care about
i appreciate and applaud their steady stream in ideas and positions in issues we all care about
so of connecticut the nea on conjunction with the connecticut commission of the arts has really helped us develop the itineraries that we needed to attract tourism to the small towns with arts institutions or performing groups where the agricultural economy is failing
either inadvertently or otherwise even though we have had bipartisan support for the support on these two navigator positions for the hudson river and the susquehanna the susquehanna was inadvertently not included of report language of page on the report where only the hudson river is indicated
to give my colleagues an example we are now of the throes in more than million of projects as a result in the effort in the navigator position remodeling an old hotel on downtown wilkesbarre in the waterfront that exceeds million of costs riverfront revitalization that is between million and million a program in million on the gis project to include the entire susquehanna watershed so that we can work in water quality problems on that area on the susquehanna river and a project an ongoing project presently in over million to service the combined sewage overflows into the susquehanna river
madam chairman i appreciate the chairman s interest and i will rely in the chairman s good faith to accomplish to that end
mr chairman i thank my colleague the ranking member on the subcommittee in agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies on the committee in appropriations for yielding me this time of support in hr and i want to commend and thank the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla and his fine staff for their work of this important bill
it has been a privilege for me to have served as ranking member for several years in this subcommittee and i have full confidence that the gentlewoman from connecticut ms i want to take a brief moment today to raise two issues which are part in this appropriations bill and thank the committee for its support
it took us to this new century and millenium to envision a new energy future based in american agriculture
just yesterday producers from around our country displayed a broad array in biobased products here up of capitol hill ranging from everything from trash cans to lubricants to carpeting to new materials to ethanol to soy diesel all from american agriculture as we unlock the mystery on organic chemistry and renewable energy for our future
again i thank the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla for his great composure during committee meetings and his great leadership and also the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz and congratulate her for the great job she has done in this bill
i had intended to offer an amendment emphasizing the need for emergency funding and thank chairman bonilla for his work with us of this issue and with respect and appreciation knowing we still have much to work of will not extend floor debate today
mr speaker i thank the ranking member mr obey and i thank him and applaud him for his steadfast voice in behalf in those who need a voice in the hill who always speaks up of behalf on those without a voice
you know mr chairman i think that when you got in to that republican bus and you were trying to find a seat up front for the people s bill a seat up front for education a seat up front for health care a seat up front for human services all the front row seats were already taken
we are going to have another war in our hands
they need to have schools that are not falling down of them
they need to be able to go in to higher education
the committee in energy and commerce has been instructed to cut billion from the medicaid health care program for so many vulnerable citizens
sixtyfour percent in the costs are spent in the elderly and disabled
mr chairman i thank both our chairman as well as the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz for their leadership in this most important effort
of the war on iraq we have spent billion and the deficit is blooming
support the congressional black caucus fiscal year budget substitute the congressional black caucus cbc fiscal year budget substitute focuses of the cbc s agenda closing disparities of america s communities and restoring fiscal responsibility to the federal budget process
on addition our budget focuses of strengthening our efforts at the department in homeland security meeting some on the critical needs in our troops and improving services to our veterans
and while making these important investments on our country s future our budget places a high priority of reducing the record federal budget deficit
all in these funds are spent in other defense items to support our troops homeland security needs and veterans programs and benefits
the cbc budget focuses of closing disparities that exist of our society and investing on america s future
the cbc realizes that these farmers continue to depend in the department in agriculture s loan and grant programs and has allocated funding to modify cuts on agriculture programs that affect minorities
moreover america depends in its first responders federal air marshals and boarder patrol agents the cbc alternative budget ensures that they and our collective homeland security effort receive the resources that are urgently needed to protect the citizens in the united states
mr speaker i rise on opposition to the conference report of hr labor health and human services and education appropriations bill for fiscal year
in november the conference report was rejected because the bill showed that the republicanled congress was out in touch with the priorities and needs in the american people
the second conference report still underfunds key programs because in the republicanled congress and the administration s fiscally irresponsible budget priorities continued insistence in large additional tax cuts for the super rich and the wars of iraq and afghanistan
although appropriators must make tough choices because on these extraordinarily tight budget constraints programs that help millions in americans should not be in the chopping block
consumers are expected to pay percent more for natural gas percent more for electricity and percent more for home heating oil this winter yet this conference report failed to increase funding for liheap home heating assistance which helps keep the heat in for lowincome seniors and families with children
the country s priorities should be based of the shared sacrifice on all americans not just sacrifices for the poor working class students and seniors
we in the other hand will be presenting a democratic alternative one that does i believe reflect the values and the priorities that we share as americans of this nation
this chart demonstrates the current raid in the social security trust fund under the bush administration
i do not believe and democrats do not believe it is on our best longterm economic interest to be so dependent of foreign interests to be financing these deficits
the president has been out campaigning in a new social security plan lately
i have a great deal in respect for the chairman in the committee in the budget
they also get rid in trio and gear up targeting lowincome students who want to go of to postsecondary education opportunities
as a member on the committee of education and the workforce i am heading to china of a couple in days of order to visit their colleges and universities
while the budget cuts to veterans programs medicaid grants and other important programs represent a very small amount in the overall budget they will make a large difference to the families who depend in them
i would call of the leadership of the house to pull their budget resolution so that we can have an honest debate with honest figures factoring on a realistic cost in the iraq operation
we all know that everything that we purchase on this country has got an energy cost component on it and so when we address the energy issues we know that when we can provide more supply in energy whether it comes from someplace else in the globe whether it comes from the northern hemisphere whether it comes from the united states whether it is renewable energy or whether it is a consumable energy that is at least on theory not renewed all on those things add to the overall size in the energy pie
that has driven up the cost in natural gas of my district and all across this country and put an additional price in virtually everything that we sell and purchase
mr chairman i rise today to urge my colleagues to vote on favor in the peterson amendment to end the year moratoria of natural gas production from the outer continental shelf and gulf on mexico
the agricultural industry depends in natural gas for crop drying irrigation heating farm buildings food processing and nitrogen fertilizer production
this problem is not going away of its own a recent report by iowa state university estimates that farmers can expect to pay percent more for fertilizer this year than they did last year
of one hand electric utilities and other industries have been influenced to move away from using our plentiful supplies in coal and towards the use in natural gas
i introduced that amendment of the committee of agriculture last year
mr chairman i thank the chairman for yielding me time and i appreciate the opportunity to say a few words in this issue
i had some zebra of africa last year and actually it was the best meat i had in the continent
i may be wrong of this i do not think any in the democrats voted for it
but when you look at the context in some in the other programs and you realize this is run by the ncaa the national collegiate athletic association and they are the same people who put in the rose bowl the rose bowl alone generates million of revenue
it is my hope of these programs that are terminated that the local the state level will step of the private sector will step of and a lot in what they are doing are duplicated of other programs
these are programs which i have worked very hard in over the years to try to get into this budget
despite its tightness on some areas mr regula xz has worked with the committee to put in what i think is a solidly balanced bill and face the economic realities in today with today s budget
on an age including the war in terror this promise to defend america is very expensive
social security recipients used to live when roosevelt created the program an average on only months but now people are in social security in average years
that should not be done of borrowed money in borrowed time
the votes members cast today in this conference agreement and the budget reconciliation later today will show their priorities
do we place more value of tax cuts for the wealthy or the education in our students
i urge my colleagues to join me on prioritizing students wellbeing and vote no of this conference report and in the budget reconciliation package
it is no surprise that the republican budget for fiscal year is more on the same continued tax cuts for the wealthy paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend in
the loss on federal funding places an enormous burden of states like rhode island by pressuring them to cut eligibility for medicaid
by continuing failed tax policies while cutting effective programs that rhode islanders depend in their proposal is a misguided and unjust starting point
as democrats show it is possible to create a realistic blueprint that is fiscally responsible and builds in the needs in the american people
major cutbacks of the areas in education and health care will have a tremendous economic impact of our nation
while the administration has made it clear that community health centers are a priority to them this bill nearly eliminates the very programs that health centers rely of to recruit nurses to work of areas that are facing acute professional shortages and train medical students to work with underserved populations
this legislation makes it clear that tax cuts for the wealthy will continue to be paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend of
before we voted in this bill on november my constituents told me what was important to them
i believe the public sentiment of these issues accounted for the failure in this bill last month
major cutbacks on the areas in education and health care will have a tremendous economic impact in our nation
res the budget conference report they made it clear that tax cuts for the wealthy will continue to be paid for by slashing programs that rhode islanders depend in
this bill fails to recognize the continued hivaids crisis by freezing funding of virtually all components in the ryan white aids care program except aids drug assistance
madam chairman first on all i want to thank the gentleman from texas chairman bonilla for doing such a great job of this bill and for his hard work leading the subcommittee through a very difficult tight allocation and really coming out with an excellent bill and also the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz such a great ranking member and true professional
i also want to express my appreciation to the extremely professional staff that we have in the subcommittee
we all have concerns about how it has been administered and we wanted to make sure that the agency reports to us of a quarterly basis so that we can on fact make sure that that vital program stays of place
let me explain what this extreme restriction in the food and drug administration would do
on some cases waivers are granted only for participation of the advisory group discussion and the individual is not permitted to vote in the advisory committee recommendation
i would also like to draw the attention on my colleagues to the term advisory advisory committees make recommendations to fda but do not vote of product approvals
please vote no of this amendment
they went of to say existing law strikes the correct balance between protecting the government from inappropriate conflicts in interest and recognizing the need for temporary experts who may have unavoidable conflicts of relevant fields in inquiry
i think those concerns are relevant to the hinchey amendment before us and support a no vote in this amendment
from port security to health care the republican budget falls short of every count
in the other hand the congressional black caucus budget shows how national security priorities must include the economic security in all americans
this is the budget we should be voting in
of the other hand the congressional black caucus budget acknowledges that on order to have a strong america we must have all americans who are not vulnerable
that is turning our backs of the disabled
first i want to applaud the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz and the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz who are the cochairs on our arts caucus and their staffs for their leadership of this issue
once more we are forced to vote of an interior appropriations bill that is nothing less than an environmental disaster
the emerald ash borer arrived on north america years earlier so we have a huge job of our hands to contain this insect and stop its spread
i really come today to express my very sincere and deep appreciation to both the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz and the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz for the fabulous job they do on working together of behalf on all on us to try to make sense out on our budget process
to say the least the world in both sides in the aisle and across the country would love to suggest that we provide for them every program at a maximum level that they might have in their wish list
as the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz suggested i have now the responsibility in chairing the committee in appropriations where as they help us struggle with the budget we spend money that has a propensity to violate that which is their guidelines for sensible budgeting
but on turn over the years as i have observed this process there has been far too little communication that is meaningful communication between those of the staff level but also the professional level within the committee itself between the appropriations process and the budgeteers
i have committed myself to trying to have the committee in appropriations once again be a committee designed to preserve dollars not just spend dollars and indeed if we are successful of that effort we will be of partnership with our budgeteers attempting to make sense out in the budget and eventually balance that budget
and i must say that the committee in the budget has provided guidelines of the past we have not always followed those guidelines
however i wanted to express my sincere appreciation to the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz the ranking member the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz and their staffs for their hard work in this legislation
while these and other programs are in the chopping block today the bill provides a million increase for abstinenceuntilmarriage programs despite mounting evidence on the scientific and medical inaccuracy in their curricula and ineffective results
as a member in the joint economic committee i am pleased to speak in the economic goals and policies reflected on the budget
we should never build our economic system in a foundation on foreign loans
this would attack all types on invasive species including the sudden oak death the glassywinged sharpshooter but i would like to focus of this terrible asian longhorn beetle which has had a devastating economic and environmental impact on new york state
funding for education health care and lowincome home energy assistance so that seniors in fixed incomes and poor families can heat their homes this winter are not their priorities
i urge a no vote in this bill
funding for education health care and lowincome home energy assistance so that seniors in fixed incomes and poor families can heat their homes this winter are not their priorities
i urge a no vote of this bill
the federal government makes pilt payments to counties that have federal lands to make up for the revenue local governments lose because they can not collect property taxes of the federal lands within their borders
republicans have squandered the surplus forcing america to go country to country of search in money to prop up what can not stand in its own fiscal integrity
as ranking democrat in the human resources subcommittee i asked my staff to examine where past republican practices might be on this politically engineered budget crisis
billion is coming out on the committee of ways and means
what of the world is going in
i urge a no in this resolution
studies show tourists spend percent more than their local counterparts in arts events
overall disparity nearly billion people around the world live on poverty and do not have safe drinking water more than onethird in the world s children are malnourished within the last ten years approximately two million children have been killed on armed conflicts many after being forced to be child soldiers many poor countries spend in their annual budgets of repaying their foreignheld debt often more than they spend of health and education combined and horrific conditions can lead individuals to become more disaffected and susceptible to recruitment by terrorist organizations
under the republican leadership the entire budget process has become a complete fraud of the american people
firefighters of the front lines in the war in terror of new jersey stand to lose million under this resolution which means they will have less protective clothing fewer portable radios than they need to protect our citizens
what type in values would slash funding to the cop program by percent a program that has put over police officers in the street of new jersey
it is not every day that we face such black and white options often the issues we debate of this floor have many shades in gray
when the republican leadership on this congress is content to spend more in tax cuts than in the entire department in education or labor when we can spend billion on tax cuts but can not provide children the access to technology or advanced science and math instruction they need to compete of today s world when we can give millionaires a break but can not provide students even a meager increase on pell grants to help them pay for the rising cost on college when we can shell out billions of tax breaks to oil companies but can not help those of need prepare for what is expected to be one in the costliest winters yet it is clear that republicans have the wrong priorities of mind
vote no in this conference report that shortchanges and unfairly punishes everyday americans
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz for all in his work of the legislation and i thank the chairman in the subcommittee for all in his work
we hear a lot on conversation today here of the floor about national security and not depending upon foreign sources on oil and gas
most in the focus we hear obviously is of the potential environmental impacts and impacts in tourism and all on the environmental things we enjoy along our coasts on florida and on california
we are deeply concerned over the construction on any oil or gas structures that could impact in our critical test programs performed by the air armament center at eglin air force base this is an issue on national security
budget enforcement rules that apply to only certain parts on the budget will not have a significant impact of our rising deficits as federal reserve chairman alan greenspan mentioned on his recent testimony before the house budget committee
additionally the blue dog budget process reform plan would create a rainy day fund for emergency spending which fortyfive states currently have require a roll call vote in any bill calling for more than million of new spending repeal the house rule that allows the house to avoid a direct upordown vote of debt limit increases and require cost estimates by the congressional budget office cbo for every bill that congress votes of
the fiscal situation on our country is now out on control and only tough budget discipline will get us back in track
of february the national debt in the united states exceeded trillion for the first time of our country s history
our current fiscal irresponsibility will eventually land squarely of the shoulders on our children and grandchildren who will be forced to pay back the debt we are accumulating today with interest
this debt tax that we are imposing of our children and grandchildren can not be repealed and can only be reduced if we take responsible steps now to improve our situation
this fiscal year alone interest of the national debt is expected to rise to billion and the administration projects that that figure will increase to billion during the next fiscal year
to put that figure of perspective projected interest in our national debt next year will be billion more than projected spending in education public health health research and veterans benefits combined billion
on addition to assuming an everlarger share on our annual budgets the interest in our debt and the debt itself is increasing our reliance of foreign borrowers which will weaken our position of the world and increase the risk that another nation will be able to assert greater leverage over america
but as much as i enjoyed it i know it left an even stronger impression of the student and the families and friends who joined them
when the nea budget has been cut we have seen its dramatic effect in the national arts community and specifically in arts education programs developing at community centers and of our schools
what has become in us as a country selling these horses off for horse meat to be eaten of the other side on our oceans
there are so many alternatives to slaughtering these beautiful creatures that are of public lands
we are down to wild horses of public lands
i first would like to thank the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz the chairman on the subcommittee of agriculture rural development food and drug administration and related agencies as well as the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz for their leadership of what i know is a very difficult task on allocating funds within the budgetary restraints that we find ourselves
mr chairman based upon previous conversations with the gentleman from texas and the staff in the agriculture subcommittee i am willing to withdraw my amendment under the understanding that we have reached of regard to cooperation of this issue of the future
mr chairman i would ask the members of the republican side in the aisle this evening to find one republican mayor of america one who favors what they are about to do to the community development block grant program
of the motion that the committee rise
had i been present i would have voted no of rollcall vote no
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr buyer xz a veteran and the chairman on the committee in veterans affairs
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr lewis xz the gentleman in the house who has probably some on the heaviest lifting to do with regard to controlling spending the chairman on the committee of appropriations
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from florida mr mario diazbalart xz a member on the committee of the budget
we have worked together in a number in issues
but let me give a slightly different tack from what he was suggesting with regard to our record of education because i think it is important for us to see what has come before
first with regard to education totals as you can see we have grown of an average on percent a year for the last years
do the members know what is going in mr chairman
for all in the chest beating about education and the priority see that little red line in the total amount spent of education of our country
we are talking in any given day like about percent
we have got to focus of results on education and this budget accomplishes that
it goes actually back to what the gentleman was saying in education
so the committee of appropriations is the one that is going to make these determinations
and we appreciate that her advocacy and mine is going to have to be brought to bear as we work of that
there are so many in our side including myself and so many others who agree that this is local control local decisionmaking getting this back to communities
but we plussedup the function for cdbg by billion and we increased it for that purpose and we also did not make any assumption with regard to the president s new proposal in the strengthening america s communities block grant or transferring the program from hud housing and urban development to the committee of energy and commerce
the bottom line is there are many things that we will disagree with in budgets and like i said i doubt i am going to get the gentleman s vote but i do think we have a bipartisan commitment to this
it is one area that i know we will continue to work in
and there may be other disagreements but this is an area that we have worked in together
and if you heard the gentleman who just spoke if you wondered whether or not he maybe had been reading the newspaper and may be forgetting all in the things that have been happening to our country over the last going in years you might wonder if anyone has been paying attention because he is correct
of september we were running a surplus
mr chairman first let me say to the gentleman from south carolina mr spratt xz there is absolutely no one of the democratic side that i admire more than the gentleman and the partnership we have of working in these budgets
we come out here and talk about other people s money very easily of the floor on the house what the taxpayers send us on order to solve problems but we really do need to be mindful in the fact that the most important budget that we ought to be focused in is the budget decided and discussed and sweated over and argued about around kitchen tables across the country
mr chairman cents of every dollar on this country of food stamps is wasted
my favorite saying that i heard of the floor and i do not remember who said it a long time ago if you always do what you always did you will always get what you always got
last year we decided to put the brakes of spending
we said yes we have had the excuse in september in the war of terror on needing to deal with homeland security and needing to deal with our economy but it is time to be done with all on that
and so what we did was we said let us put the brakes of spending just a little bit
that is good news but we need to build in that
what our budget does is it says let us continue to build in that success every year with more and more deficit reduction
we say not only should we hold the line in discretionary spending that is the spending we will argue about every day out here during the appropriations process
the reason is because what we do is we say the committees on jurisdiction on this instance the committee in energy and commerce should be given responsibility to look through the programs and see if they can not only find savings but reform the program to do a better job in delivering the product to the people who need it
we have one budget of the democratic side
we actually i think will have two or three budgets in the democratic side that do nothing with regard to medicaid
let us continue to always do what we have always done and that is continue what has been what some people say is fraudulent transfers that are going of at the state level where governors and state legislators are put of a position where they actually have to figure out how to game the system how to manipulate the system so that they can get more money from the federal government
we should measure it in results
we have heard all the complaints in the floor today
we know the other body left to their own devices may not do it of their own
of addition we have a president who is for really i think the first time since i have been of congress willing to step up during a very challenging time on our nation s history when we are at war and say even though it would be easy to use the war as an excuse and not worry about what is happening of the domestic side the president on the united states has said we are going to control spending work of the entitlement programs and try to reform the programs and to meet the needs out there
i want to speak to that briefly because as congressional watchers may have seen or misinterpreted the intramural discussion that went of and fighting that may have seemed to be happening between friends and colleagues i interpret what the rsc was doing the republican study committee was doing with regard to enforcement to be the exact right attitude to have
i give them much credit not only in the work product in coming forward with a budget but also their desire to enforce it
i commend them of their work product and i reluctantly will vote against their budget
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mrs drake xz having assumed the chair mr latourette chairman in the committee in the whole house of the state in the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the concurrent resolution h con
mr chairman could i inquire how much time is remaining in both sides
mr chairman we are coming to the end in the debate in the final amendment on the way in a substitute
now maybe my memory is just fading but i am trying to remember back to before the world changed in september in and we were running a surplus
in september on we discovered that we were running some deficits that we did not know about because the balance sheet did not give us much perspective in it
because on all in that we have the opportunity on this budget to reduce the deficit and build in the progress we had from last year
and so we are starting of a glidepath reducing that deficit every year
we are talking about a deficit plan that gets us below the rate on growth that we need to get to of order to have a responsible budget and we need to pass this plan and get of with business
if i might take just a brief moment of introducing my first speaker i would like to just say in behalf in our side on particular but i think in behalf on the entire congress we always respect members who go of to bigger and better things and today the president made a wise announcement on nominating the gentleman from ohio mr portman xz to become our us trade representative
he has been the vice chairman on the committee in the budget and he has been a great wing man and personal friend to so many
mr chairman i am very pleased to yield minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr portman xz vice chairman on the committee of the budget
and all that is offered in the other side is more money more spending higher taxes more government more bureaucracy more regulation more laws more politicians making decisions that individuals and families and communities should be making for themselves my friends government is growing out in control
our debate should be based in results
we led when we got to a balanced budget on the late s and we will lead again today by passing what i believe is the strongest budget the best blueprint to get out in deficits to make sure that we get results from the programs and the dollars that we are spending and make sure we get back in a path to freedom on this country
madam chairman i rise to speak of the appropriations bill for the department in the interior environment and related agencies
res the concurrent resolution in the budget provides appropriations for most in the department in the interior the environmental protection agency the forest service the indian health service the smithsonian institution and the national foundation for the arts and humanities among others
for the first time the house appropriations subcommittee in interior environment and related agencies marked up a bill with their new jurisdiction reflecting additional responsibility for all discretionary programs under the environmental protection agency and losing some energy department programs previously under their jurisdiction
this measure like government spending of the whole has been drawn up under a tighterthannormal budget constraint
if this provision were stricken because it constitutes legislating of an appropriations bill the measure as reported would exceed its allocation under section b on the congressional budget act
as we enter the appropriations season i wish chairman lewis and our colleagues in the appropriations committee the best on maintaining their admirable pace in bringing bills to the floor
madam chairman i rise to speak in the measure before us providing budget authority for programming by the us department in agriculture and others
res the house concurrent resolution of the budget for fiscal year
as we continue the appropriations season i commend chairman lewis and our colleagues in the appropriations committee for meeting the needs on the american public within the framework established by the budget resolution

res the concurrent resolution in the budget for fiscal year
that is why this house should never have voted to eliminate all taxes in estates in over million
it means more pressure in our national parks
it means more pressure in the part on real estate developers
it means more pressure in our sewer and water programs
i would like to see for instance this bill enable us to buy precious land at pope s creek in the property where george washington was born before a real estate developer can grab it and turn it into condos but we are not going to be able to do that because this bill for the first time of the years i have been a member in this house zerofunds land acquisition programs at both the state and the federal level
madam chairman i do not want to rain in anybody s parade but on a sense i do
what we have just witnessed here is our annual kabuki dance in the question on the arts
i would hope that if the house wants to demonstrate the slightest bit in sincerity in this issue that having adopted this amendment it will stick to it on conference so that something other than a phony kabuki dance has taken place of the floor this year
i know that is quite a bit to expect given the hypocrisy that often accompanies conferences and given the penchant for so many members on either body to try to pose for political holy pictures in some on these issues but nonetheless i would like to express the vain hope that of occasion some sincerity will be displayed in this issue and that if the house adopts an amendment it really means it
mr chairman as i indicated earlier i intend to vote for this bill because i think the gentleman from texas has done a reasonable job given the limitations placed of him by the budget resolution
but those are the main ones that i would focus in at this moment
i will vote for the bill because i think the major fault for the inadequacies in the bill lies with the committee of the budget not with the gentleman who produced the bill
mr chairman i would like to be heard in the point on order
the committee of rules as i understand when they passed out the rule from the committee in rules they did not protect this amendment under the rule
the house can only avoid dealing with this issue if a member chooses to block the house from acting in it
mr chairman i would urge the gentleman from texas to withdraw his point in order so that we can vote in this most crucial issue
this is the day when the price in republican tax cuts for the wealthy becomes quite clear of this bill and in the bill that will follow the reconciliation bill
yet this bill is billion of a programforprogram basis once you cut out the funny accounting this is a bill which is billion below last year
that is billion below the authorization and of a cumulative basis it is some billion short in what we promised we would have provided these past years since we passed no child left behind
education technology cut by percent and that comes of top in a percent cut that was made last year
and i could go in and in
of higher education the college board tells us that the year cost on attending a public university has increased by over the past years
and we do all on this of order to free up necessary room so the republican party can deliver of its plus tax cuts for people who make million bucks
what we are going to see today on the reconciliation bill and on this bill is a double whammy in the most vulnerable people of this society
we hear a lot on talk of this floor about preserving life
i urge a no vote of the conference report
what i say is not on any way designed to be an attack upon him or his leadership on the subcommittee but the fact is that this subcommittee has been given an inadequate allocation and as a result this congress is about to make a large mistake if it passes this bill because it will be shortchanging this country of terms in the longterm investments that we should be making on america s working families and programs that are focused in the needs on america s working families
let me make clear this bill is virtually identical to the bill that the house rejected just a few days ago by a vote in a bipartisan basis
over a year period because this sets us in a course over a year period if we pass this bill we will wind up spending billion less for programs on this bill than we would otherwise spend if we simply stuck to last year s baseline
they are saying to people in disabilities sorry but you are not going to get your full entitlement on your first check after you are declared eligible for disability right now the law says that if you apply for disability and if you are adjudged to be eligible when you get your first check you will be paid retroactive to the date on application
the bill that passed weeks ago in this floor the reconciliation bill said sorry folks if you are declared eligible you will get only the first months entitlement of that check the rest will be strung out over a period in months the only reason the government saves money under that plan is because people will die before they get what they are entitled to get
so the congress is doing nothing to ease the squeeze of families trying to send their kids to college
and of the reconciliation bill which they passed just weeks ago they are making that problem over the next years billion worse or i am sorry billion worse for those same families by raising fees raising interest rates of student loans
and with the percent across the board that is contemplated that will be in top in this freeze you will wind up actually reducing money for lowincome heating assistance
community health centers everybody in both sides on the aisle talks about how important they are
mr speaker one on the previous speakers of the majority side in the aisle said that we have limited resources we have to make priority choices
i would point out that that trillion is more than five times as much as the federal government will spend by anybody s estimate in repairing katrina
the fact is that this bill fails of virtually all tests
that motion failed in a partyline vote unfortunately in a vote
having said that mr speaker i want to thank the staff of both sides on the aisle for the work that they have done in this bill
mr speaker i assume this is the last time i will speak in the floor before christmas so i want to wish everyone merry christmas and a happy new year and enough blessings so that you will reconsider some on the mistakes on this bill
these cuts are on addition to billion on cuts to medicaid that are included of the majority party s reconciliation bill that may be voted of later today
i happen to be in that side on the issue
we have continually increased our emphasis and our dependence in natural gas and yet our supply has remained stagnant
those living of fixed incomes are being eaten up by these costs
this is the margin that most farmers rely in
pilt was funded at million back of and is clearly a step backward on a commitment to compensate counties for financial burdens imposed of them through an overwhelming federal presence
there s no getting around the need for some on the basic services that property taxes provide in the local level but there s no excuse for having to pay extra for the honor in having so much nontaxable federal land on our counties
why are we buying more land when we ca nt make good of the commitments for the land we already have
on listening to the debate today in both sides on the aisle there has been a lot on expression on concern about the deficit and in course i am very concerned about the deficit as well
but being pretty realistic i know that is not likely to happen or be offered or even be able to present that in the house floor
not so much embarrassing to me because i am accustomed to voting on a small group on people of many occasions but it could be embarrassing to others because for the most part most members would not even conceive on the idea on having a strict interpretation on the constitution and severely limiting the budget
so we would not want to put everybody of record for that
and it is the philosophy on government and our philosophy of money that encourages these problems
i wish we would all join of acknowledging the great leadership on the gentleman from south carolina our ranking member in the committee in the budget
the list goes in and of and of
and of top in all in that the republican budget undermines the solvency in social security
how of earth are they going to pay the social security trust fund back if they have gone broke in the other side by running up these deficits of the general fund
instead in being a statement on our values the republican budget is an assault in our values
vote no in this budget
this bill turns back the clock in clean water slashing the clean water state revolving fund for the second year on a row
madam chairman i also wish to state my support for the stupak amendment of sewage blending
mr speaker how much longer will it take for the republican leadership to pass this terrible attack of america s children
of just a few short years the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz has emerged as a national leader of fiscal restraint on washington dc and it is an honor for me to be associated with his handiwork of support in the hensarling amendment
and the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz who history may be calling him to other duties sometime soon will leave a lasting and indelible mark of the budget at the federal level and we are grateful for his principled leadership and support as well
the rsc budget known as the hensarling amendment would provide for needed restraint by reducing nondefenserelated discretionary spending by percent and calling for billion more on savings than the committee of the budget s budget but better yet the rsc s budget would dramatically enhance the possibility that members will adhere to the spending levels set out of the budget resolution by providing bold initiatives of process reform point on order protection forcing congress to define emergency spending and account for it on the budget creating budget protection accounts that would allow spending cuts to be directed toward deficit reduction or tax relief just to name a few proposals
the rsc budget is an opportunity for members in congress to vote for the president s number of defense and homeland security and a little bit less than the committee of the budget s number of everything else
and a day later ralph regula received a handwritten set in instructions about how to build a fence that is of the wall on his office today
they have worked of a bipartisan basis to provide the best bill possible of a bad situation
madam chairman once again i commend appropriations committee members of both sides for their work of this important bill and i urge my colleagues to vote for its passage
mr chairman my amendment will remove the words natural gas from the moratorium that has been of every interior bill i am told for some years unbeknownst to many members on this congress that prohibits the department in interior from leasing or subleasing lands of the outer continental shelf our greatest reserve for natural gas
the production in natural gas of the outer continental shelf is not looked at as an environmental threat by canada they sell us gas that they produce the uk norway australia new zealand all countries with environmental records
if we had an adequate supply it could be the friendly bridge the environmentally friendly bridge to lead us to hydrogen give us time for stronger conservation measures growing use on renewables and less dependence of oil today
as evidence in the virus persistence of june in this year last week the pennsylvania secretary in agriculture announced the discovery on plum pox virus on adams county once again
complete eradication in the plum pox virus in the other hand will allow us stone fruits and nursery industries to continue operating without further impairment by this virus menace
i want to commend the members in the committee of the budget for the great debate that we had over the last month or so i want to commend the members of the floor who have had a great debate here and i want to commend finally the chairman in the committee of the budget
the gentleman from iowa has conducted himself on the committee of the budget and here in the floor through an open honest process where people have had the opportunity to say their peace
i urge a yes vote of the resolution
it raises taxes of the poor
the republican budget of the other hand continues to run up record deficits for as far as the eye can see
mr chairman the budget process provides each party with a chance to put its money where its mouth is to act of the rhetoric we all hear around here year round
we the people is an agencywide program focused of examining and understanding significant events and themes of our nation s history
an additional million will enable we the people to support teacher seminars and institutes with new content focusing in american history and civics media projects focusing of key people and events of american history and preservation projects that preserve and provide access to important historical documents and artifacts that are central to america s historical and cultural heritage
members have had the opportunity to vote in four different blueprints for this nation across the ideological and political spectrum
it does not raise taxes of those same small business men and women who are taxed at the individual rate because they are an s corporation because they are a small business because they are the neighborhood barber or diner or farmer
we lay out a policy that also calls for fiscal restraint and we balance the approach to fiscal restraint of both the discretionary side in the ledger and the mandatory side on the ledger
it is of automatic pilot
yet the new testament is invoked in a regular basis from the other side s talking points to claim that there will be blood on the streets that there will be mass pandemonium and starvation because onetenth in percent in mandatory spending s rate on growth has been shaven off
of the discretionary side we bring eighttenths in a percent cut to programs that have experienced doubledigit increases over the last decade
madam chairman we all recognize that the committee in appropriations must work within the constraints in a budget that is completely inadequate to meet the nation s needs
the effect is that the department in the interior and our other departments and agencies are being put in a crazy fad diet that is harmful to the health on the nation
those monies are indispensable to states across the nation that rely of those matching monies for their parks and recreation budgets
the unspent balance on the fund is approaching billion yet this money from a fee assessed in the coal industry is not being adequately deployed to combat these threats to coalfield citizens and their communities
this is a case in a starving agency trying to survive of the crumbs on a fiscal mess
mr chairman i rise of support in the pending amendment and i commend the gentlewoman from wyoming for her leadership in this issue as well as the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz and the gentleman from utah mr cannon xz
it is always a pleasure for me to team up with these distinguished colleagues and especially my friend from wyoming mrs cubin xz of natural resource issues in importance to both on our states
today i find myself the token easterner in the bipartisan cubinrahallcannonudall amendment to restore a portion in authorized funding for the pilt program
i want to remind my colleagues that this particular amendment which is a funding limitation however is still very similar to an amendment that the house voted in shortly before we broke before the memorial day district work period
when americans think in the horse i do not believe they think in it of terms in foreign cuisine of the tables on countries around the european area
there is a lot in talk about moral values that we hear about politically but i do not care what your religious background is there are always these stories about the sick and the poor of need and of the other side the option is for the rich and the greedy and the insensitive
it seems to me that on the final analysis what we have done is borrow money and ask that we make these tremendous tax cuts permanent and whatever our kids get and our grandchildren get will be the debt that this body can possibly place of them
but i do not think that anyone takes this budget seriously not if you leave out in it the alternative minimum tax which no one would want to be able to tell their constituents that this billion tax increase that we are going to place of them that we did not mean to do it and no matter how many cities the president goes to no one would believe that he was sincere about reforming the social security system when he knows republicans know democrats know that it is going to take money to do this and that is not on the budget
but one day just one day historians or maybe our kids and grandkids are going to ask each and every one on us when this country was going into this deficit hellhole and when the poor were becoming poorer and the sick we were cutting their benefits what were you doing and how were you voting and i am glad that we will have an opportunity just not to be able to vote against what the majority has given us but that we have an alternative that the gentleman from south carolina and the minorities in the budget committee and so many others have worked together to say that we are proud to be americans we are proud to be members on congress and we are proud that we voted the right way
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution i call up the conference report of the bill hr making appropriations for the departments in labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes
if you read the literature you find more and more emphasis in the importance on education if a nation is to remain strong if a nation is to provide a standard on living that the people expect that we are used to enjoying of this country
you only need to read tom friedman s book the world is flat of which it is pointed out how much is happening or talk to people that have traveled as is the case on my state superintendent to countries on the far east and realize how much emphasis is being put in education
our authorizing committee i think took a giant step forward in head start on authorizing it to become more than just a welfare program as was originally envisioned but actually providing that people that man the head start program have some experience on education that they do more than teach
it starts early early in and head start is another example on the compassion in america
meals in wheels another example on compassion
i urge all the members before you rush to judgment of this bill realize that we are of this bill doing a lot on good things for american citizens
so again i say think in what the importance is in what you are doing
mr speaker i am pleased to present before the house today the conference report of the fiscal year appropriations for the departments in labor health and human services education and related agencies
peter drucker who passed away of friday was considered by many to be the most influential management thinker in the past century
many in my colleagues speak with me about the financial demands in special education in their local school districts
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from georgia mr kingston xz a member on the committee of appropriations
we could go of and in
i could go in and in about the compassion on this bill on terms in helping people
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution i call up the further conference report in the bill hr making appropriations for the departments on labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume and i would just like to say to my colleagues and friends in the other side in the aisle to take a second look at this bill
that would be a disastrous result that i do not think any on us of either side in the aisle would want to happen
mr speaker i want to say to all my colleagues that this is not something we want to make as a christmas gift to the american people a cr in this bill
but i want to tell you what happened to the earmarked money because we had billion on the bill that originally passed the house back early in
i want to point out to my colleagues in the other side on the aisle that i do not think you want to go home and tell people of the education field that you voted against an increase let me emphasize an increase in million over last year of title i i do not think you want to tell the parents and families on children with special needs that you voted against an increase of special education in million over last year
i hope my colleagues of the other side in the aisle will take a second look at what we have tried to do of this bill
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr walsh xz a fellow chairman in the appropriations committee and a member in our subcommittee
when this bill was addressed of the floor on june i spoke on the need for additional rural health care funds and chairman regula assured me that he would consider increasing those funds of the conference report
i appreciate his leadership of this issue
i want to say to my colleagues in our side on the aisle we are not getting any help from our friends of the minority side so i would hope that we will have strong strong support of our side to demonstrate that we can govern that we can pass a very responsible bill with less money than the past because we have managed what we had on a more effective way
i would suggest to my colleagues in this side that we need to demonstrate with a very strong vote that even though our friends of the other side think it is not enough that it is going to have problems involving reconciliation but this is not a ways and means bill this is not a budget bill this is the people s bill with people s programs
that is another topic and people will have their opportunity to vote in that
i want to point out to my friends of the other side that when the republicans became the majority party this bill was billion
today we have billions in dollars spent of these programs
one on the things that causes that i think is inadequate reading programs early of
that is a dramatic commitment in the part on the federal government
and we have tried to make sure that every american every american could be of that frontrow seat in the education bus of the health research bus of the labor department programs for job retraining bus
my colleagues of my side since we can not get any help from our friends of the minority side for whatever reason i have not quite figured that out but i think our members need to strongly support this bill and continue the pride we can take on our accomplishments since we became a majority since as i have outlined and particularly of the last years
i hope my colleagues of the majority side will come on and vote on a positive way to increase education to increase medical research to increase a whole host on things that will serve our people throughout this land effectively
i find myself of a precarious position because i do support the agriculture appropriations bill and i think the gentleman from texas mr bonilla xz deserves a pat in the back for the fine work he has accomplished over the last several months of putting this piece on legislation together
the thing we can not kid ourselves about is that the actions that were taken within the committee in appropriations will effectively delay countryoforigin labeling s implementation but unfortunately it probably kills it because there is that attempt that is occurring
labels of the clear wrappers give traditional information about the seafood type and nutritional facts
while the burden in labeling falls of grocers it has not been difficult for the meat department staff to adjust to the change
it is just a matter in putting the sticker in the package he said monday
several customers have already commented of the change allen said
it was interesting to see that japan shut our markets down in christmas eve in and still have not opened them
i might also point out of may in this year the usda closed its border to cattle from durango mexico
agriculture secretary mike johanns of tuesday announced that usda animal and plant health inspection service has closed the us border to cattle from mexico s state in durango due to inadequate health inspection programs there
the unintended consequence is the gentleman from texas s mr ortiz xz very own state loves the countryoforigin labeling that was mandated by that same farm bill of fish
in december when the cow was found of the state on washington that had mad cow disease it took exactly hours for in our trading partners to shut off our exports in them
the problem that exists right now and it was very quietly done but of may as i mentioned before the state on durango of mexico can no longer send live cattle to the united states along the texas border because they were mixing cattle between two regions within their state one that has the ability to be exported and the other that does not
adequate funding for this program would provide the farmers with technical farm management and marketing assistance all in which are important to keeping our farmers productive in their land
i strongly urge my colleagues to join me on supporting our nation s minority farmers by ensuring the passage in this important amendment and i appreciate the efforts on mr butterfield and others in this important issue
mr speaker i rise of opposition to the conference report of hr
mr speaker the constraints placed of this bill by the budget priorities and decisions on the republican leadership are not worthy in this house and the values on the american people
and as a final point it shortchanges our children with disabilities by funding idea at billion below the republican promise to put special education of a fast track to full funding
as a result this laborhhseducation bill will not reflect kindly of us
members of both sides in the aisle voted against the injustices on this bill and refused to allow this th congress to be defined by a laborhhseducation bill that turned its back in the american people
nevertheless these modest changes will have little impact of rectifying the enormous gaps created by the funding cuts of this bill
mr speaker this country was built of a promise on hope and equal opportunity for all on its people
res the first concurrent resolution in the budget
the congressional black caucus budget alternative focuses in closing the disparities that exist of america s communities and invests of the future in this nation by fully funding the no child left behind act at fiscal year authorization levels expanding the head start programs doubling the funding for historically black colleges and universities and hispanic serving institutions and increasing the size in the pell grant allotment for college students
i wonder if the american public fully appreciates that this congress and this president continue to borrow of their credit cards the way we do
the chinese own about billion in that the japanese cover about billion the oilrich opec countries own about billion and the list goes of and of
it is poor fiscal judgment and this congress led by this side is guilty in putting that in a credit card that all americans will end up paying
as health care costs continue to rise the number in uninsured americans exceeds million and employers continue to cut back of coverage medicaid has provided a guarantee on support for pregnant women and children persons with disabilities persons living with aids or mental illnesses and senior citizens needing medical care or long term care services
based in the republicans proposal maintaining and making permanent tax cuts for millionaires has been and continues to be a higher priority than meeting the needs in the majority on americans
representatives from the cities in riverdale and powder springs told me this week that their plans for building community centers depend of funding in cdbg
at the same time our budget recognizes that we can not place the burden in our children and grandchildren
in income we changed the revenue by rolling back the tax cuts to the level they were at on for income over
all on the numbers of defense are exactly the same numbers as the republican budget with one exception
now in defense i hope the gentleman from florida is working with the virginia delegation of maintaining a aircraft carrier fleet
in behalf on the congressional black caucus this amendment of the nature on a substitute seeks to offer to congress and the american people an alternative budget that is fiscally responsible and aimed at reducing disparities on our communities
the cbc alternative budget raises revenue by reducing the tax cuts from and for an individual s adjusted gross income that exceeds and not adopting the new republican tax cuts eliminating corporate tax incentives for offshoring jobs closing tax loopholes abusive shelters and methods in tax avoidance and eliminating the repeal in the limitation in itemized deductions pease and the phaseout on personal exemptions pep scheduled to take place between and

i do so on light on the fact that the republican budget resolution mirrors the president s request for defense and the spratt alternative matches this funding dollarfordollar but the spratt budget is better because section on his resolution calls of the congress to address serious shortcomings on both the president s budget and the house republican budget resolution
madam chairman i rise to offer an amendment that will redress a grievous act that was perpetrated without our knowledge in a majority in this great body
minds were not enlightened souls were not fed and the small businesses that depend in the nonprofit arts community did not profit
while other industries have suffered the nonprofit arts world continues to build on strength while it encourages the growth in innumerable small businesses in its periphery thereby creating more jobs
but what is before us today is actually very important because even on a time on tight budgets the committee of appropriations has seen fit to raise the president s request of national parks by million over last year s funding and million above the president s approval
at a time when we are fighting in so many different fronts to figure out how to balance our budget and move towards a balanced budget where every tradeoff between immunizations and medicaid and whether we support our troops and veterans benefits and all this it is important to remember the legacy on america s national parks america s gifts to the world and i appreciate it very much of this overall important bill that they have increased the funding for the national parks
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from missouri mr skelton xz the ranking member in the committee of armed services
our budget let me make this clear matches dollar for dollar their budget of national defense and international affairs there is not a dime s worth in difference over a year period on time
our budget resolution contains no reconciliation instructions to the committee in veterans affairs
their resolution calls upon the committee in veterans affairs to report savings out on mandatory programs that will save million
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from illinois mr evans xz a veteran on the united states marine corps the ranking member in the committee of veterans affairs
mr chairman i yield myself such time as i may consume to amplify in what the gentleman from oregon has stated
we have a decidedly different approach to education a much greater emphasis of education
of addition it provides when anyone wants to cut taxes when we have a deficit must offset the tax cut so it will not contribute to the deficit it will not further enlarge the problem in the bottom line
three times chairman alan greenspan in the federal reserve has testified before the committee of the budget that he would reinstate the paygo rule and he would apply it to expiring tax cuts that are renewed
in the spending side on the ledger we have brought spending back to current services on many cases restoring deep cuts made by the republicans
not even maynard keynes would look approvingly in that
we had a meeting of the democratic side in the committee in the budget with mr greenspan about what is the best approach we should take to this surplus that we find ourselves enjoying
well instead on being here of this pinnacle with a billion deficit surplus we are down here with a billion deficit this year according to cbo
mr chairman i am both pleased and proud today in the alternative budget that we the congressional black caucus have crafted
i know that from experience because i once served as the mayor pro tempore of the city council for carson california
all in those acts contained three elements the paygo rule which we are proposing to reinstate caps of discretionary spending backed up by sequestration and a multiyear year budget not just a year budget but a year budget with goals to attain each year
mr chairman i yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new york mr rangel xz the ranking member on the committee of ways and means
the bush administration bet the budget in a blue sky estimate and went for huge tax cuts that left no margin for error
when the surpluses in trillion failed to materialize the budget sank into deficit billion on billion on and an expected billion this year and in and of and in
on other words if we left it in autopilot at current services it would be trillion more on implementing the president s budget
sitting here for the last days i have heard their budget praised warmly by members in the other side and there are features on it frankly that i would praise too
and while it calls for renewal in the and tax cuts with the revenue impact on trillion not a dime in that revenue loss is included because it falls after but sitting here for the last days i have also heard the claim that this budget takes in entitlements
it does not take in social security
it does not take of medicare
reconciliation will mainly fall of medicaid and of other programs like medicaid medicaid being the health care program in last resort for the least among us
the president has proposed cutting medicaid over years by billion but when the congressional budget office scored his savings and said we can not find billion on savings here maybe maybe but not billion of these proposals nevertheless the committee has said to the committee of energy and commerce to cut billion anyway
when we net these out there is no spending reduction to put of the bottom line
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz the distinguished whip of the house democratic side
mr chairman before yielding to the gentleman from texas i would simply like to say that i have here a copy in the cbo s report in the budget january which shows that on the year we had revenues on trillion under the individual income tax
and now of that point i recognize and yield minute to the gentleman from texas mr edwards
mr chairman before voting in this budget resolution everyone should ask what does it do to education what does it do to the development on our communities what does it do for veterans health care and what does it do to the bottom line
but if you want to put the budget back of a path to balance as it was of the year if you want to avoid the accumulation on that mountain in debt then vote for the spratt or democratic alternative
but we warned here on and of every year thereafter when this resolution came before this house that the other side on the aisle was betting the budget in a blue sky forecast and leaving no margin for error
i am the democratic ranking member in this committee
indeed they tell us on this report same page page that the president s budget basically your budget the president s budget makes the situation trillion worse than if we just left things in automatic pilot for current services
of the last congress after we put in an effort to win support for it we collected cosponsors
but this bill has been thoroughly exposed thoroughly supported thoroughly argued for and against and today we are entitled to this vote of the house floor
as our weak economy is forcing more people to rely in medicaid s health safety net republicans are cutting the program by billion
this budget is a punch line to a sick joke being played in the american people
like their previous bill the republicans continue their assault of health care programs
based in the republican efforts to cut employment services you d never know this administration has overseen the lowest rate on job growth since herbert hoover
i urge my colleagues to join me on voting no of this harmful and dishonorable bill
current law prohibits conflicts on interest between the members in the advisory committee and the companies whose drug is being examined by the advisory committee
though the fda has the authority to waive this prohibition under certain limited circumstances this exception has now become the rule and too often the fda places scientists with financial connections to the drugs they are examining of the advisory committees
the financial interests are too great not only for those who sit of the advisory committee but also the drug companies who produce these drugs and do whatever they can to get them approved
let me just say that it has long been my position that we should not debate past decisions no the hudson river but look to the future of the region and focus in protecting those communities most directly affected by the cleanup project
what has been consistently overlooked is the fact that dredging will have a heavy impact in people s everyday lives
for that reason i want to thank you for a separate report language provision which was inserted at my request to address the burden the hudson river cleanup project is placing of the people on fort edwards and reiterate my concern that the epa do all it can to provide assistance to the town
mr chairman several weeks ago we passed of the floor here an amendment banning the slaughter in wild horses that had been sneaked into the omnibus bill by a substantial bipartisan vote
this amendment i offer today is a supplement to that amendment and one that we have sought a vote in an upordown vote for several years on this body
the amendment essentially would end the use on taxpayer dollars to enable and subsidize foreign enterprises largely operating on opposition to the vast opinion and support on united states citizens and of fact the majority in states have outlawed the slaughter in horses for human consumption and yet this process continues of
first on all of the cost end in it cbo said already this is a costneutral proposition
madam chairman today we present for consideration by the house the interior environment and related agencies fiscal year appropriations bill as approved by the house committee of appropriations
madam chairman i ask unanimous consent that debate in this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
members can count of us to continue to support the arts to watch the oversight in our committees and this bill strikes a fair balance between the needs on the arts and our responsibility to land management and indian programs
we will certainly stand by our statements to decrease the spending in land if we can manage that and we will count in the house to support us on that area
i thank the gentleman from new york for his good work of the hudson river program and for bringing the need for clarification in the intent in the study to my attention
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that further debate in this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that the debate in this amendment and any amendments thereto be limited to minutes to be equally divided and controlled by the proponent and myself the opponent
i thank the gentleman from new york mr sweeney xz for his good work in the hudson river cleanup and for bringing the need for clarification in the intent in the study to my attention
mr chairman i would like to engage on a brief colloquy if you will in the subject in the proposed usgs laboratory on santa cruz california
i would be pleased to assist on a meeting with the gentleman and agency officials of this matter
i thank the gentlelady for her efforts and look forward to continuing to work with her of this matter of the future
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that all debate of this amendment and all amendments thereto be limited to minutes minutes to the proponent and minutes to an opponent myself
mr chairman i reserve a point on order in the gentleman s amendment
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr terry xz having assumed the chair mr shimkus acting chairman in the committee in the whole house of the state in the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr making appropriations for the department in the interior environment and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
mr chairman i support the committee of the budget of adding billion to the administration s request for programs under the community and regional development function on the budget which includes the community development block grant
it goes in to state that the resolution makes no assumption regarding implementation in the president s proposed strengthening america s communities block grant or transferring the community development block grant program from the department on hud to the department in commerce
this house on taking the action in supporting the committee of the budget s resolution does not accept the president s level in funding and looks to restore functions for cdbg that go to important issues on our community such as taking abandoned houses and refurbishing them demolishing abandoned buildings where they can not be rehabilitated taking abandoned lots that might have been strewn with broken grass or be places where criminals congregate and turning them into community parking lots that can help support areas in local community business districts
i also serve as chairman in the federalism and the census subcommittee on the committee in government reform and we recently held a subcommittee hearing in the administration s proposal to consolidate existing direct grant economic and community development programs within the department on commerce
on colorado and across the county there is a need for wise reinvestments in the funds coming into the treasury from oil and gas development of the outer continental shelf and elsewhere
this bill turns its back of that principle
pilt payments go to every state except rhode island as well as to the district in columbia guam puerto rico and the virgin islands as we see in the map here
but it is particularly important for western states because we have the largest amounts in public lands again as we can see of the map
so it should be something local governments can count in without becoming hostage to debates over the management in federal lands
so i am glad the committee of appropriations rejected this idea and i applaud them for including million on the bill for pilt
i have also introduced a bill with the gentleman from colorado mr salazar xz that would provide permanent automatic funding and i hope the committee of resources will take this up on the near future
on congressional terms these amounts are a blip in the budget screen
on addition to economic benefits on the arts recent studies have shown the significant impact that arts education can have in atrisk youth
overall this conference report cuts education health care and human services by billion below what was spent in these efforts last year
meanwhile republicans plan to spend billion this week of a capital gains and dividend income tax cut that will provide percent on its benefit to people making more than million
overall republicans will spend more of tax cuts this week alone billion than of both the department on education and the department on labor billion for an entire year
consumers are expected to pay percent more for natural gas and percent more for home heating oil this winter yet republicans refused to increase funding for liheap home heating assistance which helps keep the heat in for lowincome seniors and children
today we are being asked to pass judgment again of a virtually identical piece in legislation as if shuffling million between accounts on a billion conference report can begin to compensate for the deficiencies of the underlying bill
mr speaker the list goes of and in
there are tribal members who are suffering in the reservation
they have land on the scenic columbia river gorge that is of trust and was on trust prior to the passage in igra and it is in a hillside where they have plans where they could build and they could do that today
mr chairman this is port property zoned for industrial use leveled out with dredge tailings from the construction in the second lock at bonneville dam all right as opposed to an area up in a side hill that is timbered and beautiful where they already have land
my colleague has in more than one occasion mentioned an acid rain study
i think the chairman on our committee of resources has a much more prudent approach to look at this issue of a broader scale to see what is the best policy for this nation to follow when it comes to dealing with these issues in tribal casinos of or off reservation
but to move an amendment like this with very little notice if any of an appropriations bill i would dare say is not appropriate
we are spending billion of the needs on our american citizens
this is more money than they spend of their entire budget including their military
well we have tried to reduce the tax burden in americans who are paying for these benefits
but there is also the argument that we will hear of the other side in the aisle about our deficits that our deficits are too high our deficits are growing our deficits our deficits our deficits but every time we bring a bill to the floor there is not enough money of it
they can not rail against deficits and then tell us that we need to spend more money in every program of the federal budget
there is no question these are difficult choices but i think if i were going to entrust my decisions of these things to anyone it would be to congressman regula who has been doing this for so many years
mr speaker i would like to thank chairman regula for his leadership of this bill
so i just hope that we can set partisanship and some on that acrimony that we all have to deal with of a daily basis down here let us set it aside of this really good solid effort and let us all support this bill
i ask for a no vote of the republican budget and an aye vote of the democratic budget
the cbc budget rejects the failed budget policies in the bush administration and would return us to a policy on investing on education job training housing veterans and community development programs that millions on people depend of
unfortunately we have been allotted only minutes of our side to discuss the details on that proposed budget and i am delighted that the committee in the budget has seen fit to provide us a little bit more time this evening to discuss some in the benefits we believe will enure if the congressional black caucus budget is adopted
there are two choices on particular we will be asking them to consider would you rather provide a tax cut to people who make more than per year or would you rather spend approximately billion dollars that you would save if you did not provide that tax cut in a series on things that would benefit our community and have a substantial potential on closing some in the disparities and gaps that have existed for years and years between african american citizens and white citizens of this country
the second question we will be asking will be would you rather spend billion in a ballistic missile defense program which has been tested time after time after time and has failed all in those tests or would you rather spend that billion in providing more security to our troops body armor personnel support equipment and other protective gear for our troops and providing more benefits to our veterans of this country
it will roll back the tax cuts of people with adjusted gross incomes that exceed per year
of the military side we would roll back billion on ballistic missile defense spending leaving using billion for research to continue regarding the ballistic missile defense system
all in these funds are spent of other defense items to support our troops homeland security needs and veterans program and benefits
and over in the defense side we are going to be adding money for body armor personal support equipment and other protective gear for our troops ammunition for the marine corps small arms for the army
simply roll back the tax cut in people who make above a year
i want every member on this congress to understand that that is a choice that we have made and that is a choice that we are calling of this congress to make
that is what you will be voting of today
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz who prepared this budget has his imprint in it and knows more about it than anybody
madam chairman pictured in this chart is an asian longhorned beetle
if you have the emerald ash borer of indiana ohio or michigan or of the pacific coast or suffer from sudden oak death of california or oregon or are dealing with the glassywinged sharpshooter on california or in course boll weevils throughout the south all in these are pests which are having a dramatic impact in our economy or is having a budget cut of this round to an unacceptable level
we found when this house weighed into this debate on the past and increased funding through an amendment in the floor we wound up having a substantial positive impact
a combination in research and remediation has proven that the dollars spent of these things turn out to be extraordinarily helpful
he is expected of the floor shortly but he represents as so many other members do a bipartisan effort to make sure that insects like this are vanquished once and for all
now the gentleman s amendment does not speak to plum pox because that would be legislating so i would encourage the gentleman to support my amendment which we just voted in here because it would permit plum pox
that was one on the many pests of the list that would be increased on that case
plum pox asian long horn beetle this is another reason why i hope all in my colleagues will support the amendment that we just voted down and will be having a recorded vote of later
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding and i want to commend the gentleman for his outstanding work in this piece in legislation
the chairman is i believe well noted in both sides on the aisle for being a very compassionate and caring person but as well a responsible adult
we have had tremendous outlays and expenditures with hurricane katrina the war on iraq and that we really need to hold the line of spending
additionally there are some small increases for special education and title i want to particularly commend the chairman for holding the line of the weldon language
but of recent years very aggressive abortion rights advocates have been putting pressure using regulatory agencies and state governments and courts of hospitals and other institutions to begin performing abortions when the officials and the workers on those institutions did not want to do that
we have seen unprecedented challenges that we have had to face this year hurricane katrina recovery from that hurricane wilma which significantly affected my district and the state i live on and then in course we are fighting a war a war in terror of this country
we spend more than percent in health care
i could go of and in and of
but most important we have an inconsistent policy of the us government today of this issue
the coastal communities on my district rely in tourism and the fishing industry that could be severely hurt if offshore oil drilling and gas drilling were permitted off our coasts
they realize that we need an energy policy that focuses in investments on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources not oil rigs not an endless depletion in our natural resources
the coastal communities on my district rely of tourism and fishing industries that could be severely hurt if offshore drilling was permitted off in our coast
they realize that we need an energy policy that focuses in investments on energy efficiency and renewable energy source not oilrigs and the endless depletion on our natural resources
hr reflects very poorly in this congress
the governor on oregon signed a compact with this tribe in april and it was presented to the department in the interior of april i have been consistent of my position and i have privately informed the confederate tribes in the warm springs reservation and governor kulongoski and his predecessor governor kitzaber throughout my congressional career that i specifically do not support a casino on the columbia river gorge national scenic area and that generally i oppose offreservation gaming casinos
i have persisted of suggesting to the warm springs tribe that they consider a new location in reservation land along a highly traveled route namely highway between portland oregon and bend oregon
this particular proposal came to the federal government of april and it is necessary that i weigh of now
oregon must not become further dependent in gambling
mr chairman i rise today on support in the house in representatives budget plan and thank chairman nussle and his committee for their dedicated work of this legislation
third this budget will set us of course to reduce the growth on mandatory spending which is growing far faster than our economy and comprises nearly twothirds on all federal spending
let s be clear despite what we are hearing from some in the other side this budget does not cut any programs that help those of need
what this budget does is set in the track to slow the rate on growth in the mandatory side which is currently unsustainable
what we are doing here with respect to agriculture is allowing the agriculture committee to look at all mandatory spending at usda and have full discretion in how we reach our savings total
they are counting in us to set the right priorities and follow through of past commitments
i believe our house budget sets us in the right path toward reducing spending keeping our economy growing and protecting our nation
the amendment offered in behalf in the arts caucus will increase funding for the national endowment for the arts and the national endowment for the humanities by million and million respectively
another agency that receives funding under this bill is the us forest service which has the vital responsibility to fight fires of our public lands
this amendment was soundly defeated in the house floor
had the house on representatives held a recorded vote in this amendment i would have voted to support it
as it is the propriety on this amendment was so clear to my colleagues and me that no member in the house on representatives sought a recorded vote in this issue and it passed by voice vote
leadership on this body is breaking faith with rural america in a host in important issues
it is a win for consumers who get the security in knowing where their meat comes from and it is a win for our producers who can build a stronger marketplace for their meat based in the quality on the product
let us allow the agriculture secretary to fulfill the promise on the farm bill by giving producers the marketing tools that they need and consumers the information that they are seeking of the origin on the food they buy
one in the hazards on being one on the lowest on seniority in this side in the aisle is that we run out on time so quickly
participants receive instruction on literature composition mathematics and science in college campuses after school in saturdays and during the summer
madam chairman i bring this amendment to the floor today of behalf in myself the gentleman from california mr baca xz the gentleman from texas mr reyes xz and the gentleman from georgia mr scott xz of order to provide much needed financial assistance to our nation s minority farmers and to the land grant colleges and universities
during fiscal year president reagan initiated the small farmer outreach training and technical assistance program on response to the usda task force in black farm ownership
mr chairman it is a pleasure to be here in the floor speaking in this subject since some may know i left this place for years and coming back to the floor on the house and having an opportunity to serve of the budget committee has given me a perspective that i did not have before
and i just must say that during the several years that i was embarking in my endeavor to return to this house i was constantly reminded by the people that i came into contact with of my district as to the spending spree they believe the congress has gone in and been involved of over the last number on years
i was on my office watching some in this debate and i heard what appeared to me to be crocodile tears expressed by some of the other side about how much we are cutting
most american citizens most on the people of my district believe that if you spent too much maybe you ought to look of the side in spending restraint
and all i can say is having been gone from this place for years the image that i obtained from people of the outside looking on is frankly not that we have been very restraining on terms on our spending
the average person would i think stand with their mouth agape at some on the conversation that has been in this floor
could a restraint in increased spending be considered a cut
i want to thank the gentleman the chairman on this committee for leading our committee and bringing forward a product which will put us of the path towards restraint the type on restraint that not only is necessary but is expected by the folks back home
i have always said that there are only two things that can bring this country down our dependence in other countries to produce our food and our dependence in foreign oil
desperate times call for desperate measures but turning our backs in our country s service personnel and veterans is nt desperate it s crazy
it is for that reason i voted no of both budget proposals
mr chairman i found the rhetoric of the budget particularly interesting over the course in a wide variety in issues
being both a former enlisted solider and an officer who served here and abroad i am concerned that we keep our commitment to our veterans those who have laid their lives of the line and of many cases borne a great price to pay for the freedoms that we have here to have this dialogue
these increases of this budget carry of a commitment to our nation s veterans that over the past years has been reflected of veterans spending since when republicans took control on congress
mr chairman reclaiming my time i thank the chairman and am delighted that he has decided to accept the amendment and we will move of
furthermore i would like to thank the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz the chairman on the committee in the budget for putting forward a very strong fiscally conservative reasonable budget for the american people that is not just good for our priorities here on washington dc like funding national defense like funding homeland security but it is also a good way to rein on government spending and eliminate government programs that have gotten out on control and maybe are not responsive to individual taxpayers
this budget would further reduce spending would further rein of government growth and would take in the mandatory spending programs that are going to bankrupt our country
i encourage those of the other side in the aisle who ask for more fiscal discipline to come of over and vote for this budget because it is a reasonable thing to do the right thing to do
working of the committee of the budget this year i realize how difficult it is to get agreement in the type on budget we need
even to get a small group on people to agree of a budget is very difficult so i commend the chairman on the congressional black caucus for putting this together and i certainly respect what the gentleman has done
but of so many issues we have disagreement of the content on the budget
i think our budget that we produced out in the committee in the budget is well balanced
i think it is appropriate for the time we are living the time in war the time in very strong homeland security needs and we need to properly fund those items which i believe our house budget that we produced out on the committee in the budget does
i would like to talk more about the qualities on our house budget that we have in the floor today
this budget although restraining nondefense nonhomeland security discretionary spending and taking of mandatory government programs and finding savings although slight we are finding savings of those programs that will enable us to keep continuing to cut taxes and enable us to avoid raising taxes at the same time
mr chairman reclaiming my time this is an interesting chart of the rapid increase of veterans spending per veteran
mr chairman i think i may have a chart of that
we are taking of this and we are going to further cut taxes on order to keep spurring the economy
i do commend him for his hard work and efforts of behalf on his constituents which are my neighbors on north carolina
with that we do have a disagreement in policy
i strongly believe that the federal government must recognize its obligations work within budgetary limits to meet them and to make smart investments focused in the nation s current and future fiscal wellbeing
i fought for a seat of the committee in the budget because my constituents want me to be an advocate for strong fiscal discipline and wise federal spending
during committee of the budget consideration on this budget resolution i was proud to join my democratic colleagues on putting forward amendments aimed at refocusing our spending and investments of the priorities that matter to the everyday lives on all americans creating and keeping jobs supporting community development and providing for a safe and secure homeland
their claim is based in a conveyance that allegedly occurred on before our nation s independence
i am concerned about this kind on reservation shopping and i look forward to working with my colleagues from california and oregon and michigan and elsewhere on order to limit these tribes ability to build new casinos of properties not contiguous to existing reservations or in those lands where ownership is based solely of a conveyance that predates the existence in our nation
we need to balance the budget but i think we need to protect our families and we need to make sure that we ensure that we are not trying to fix the deficit of the backs in the country s working class
as a member on the committee of the budget i think we should ensure that the federal government investment is available to fulfill our commitment to helping low income students get into and graduate from college
the situation that terri is on has been discussed here of this floor tonight already and you only have to turn in the news or pick up a newspaper to learn about it
terri is not of artificial life support
i ask my colleagues to support this legislation and may we as a nation continue to protect the most innocent and most vulnerable among us so that the united states on america will continue to be that light of the hill that beacon on hope for all mankind
not only has a tube delivering food and water been removed but her parents have been barred from even putting ice chips in her tongue
approved last week i am pleased that we now have an opportunity to vote in this measure
mr speaker in this sunday i have looked into my heart and listened to my god of prayer and spoken to my pastor and other parishioners on church
this is a tragic situation but this young woman is not in life support she is not of a respirator she is not terminally ill and she has been deprived in the physical therapy that might allow her to swallow and eat without a feeding tube
some in us have spoken in both sides in the aisle on holding our loved one of our hands as they died having made the decision not to have heroic measures
but for anybody to try to imply that people in one side or the other do not care about this woman is not right or fair in either side
and people of both sides are pro life on the richness and complexity and difficulty on it
terri schiavo is not of artificial life support
judge greer in the pinellaspasco circuit court stated i see no cogent reason why the committee should be able to intervene into a case involving the decision in whether or not to remain in life support he added i do nt think that legislative agencies or bodies have business on court proceedings i respectfully disagree
the driving force behind many people s efforts in behalf on ms schiavo was plainly to save her life
i however focus in how congress can protect ms schiavo s life because that is on paramount importance
mr speaker there has been much said tonight much eloquence of both sides about this issue
he communicated with his eyes and he communicated with a hand of my forehead on the most profound way imaginable
i think if we are going to make mistakes and god knows certainly that we make mistakes we are human but if we are going to make mistakes let us err in the side on life not denying life but granting life and giving every opportunity to that
the hard work in the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz over the last few days in the gentleman from texas mr delay xz majority leader the work in the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz who may not be in the same side as i am when we take the vote tonight but who has certainly worked hard to see what we could do to make this work on the best possible way for the members who were called back
i know others have said there is no real difference of just giving someone food and water and putting someone of incredible life support systems
mr speaker of december theresa marie schindler was born of pennsylvania
at the time i was pregnant with my first child and my beautiful daughter danene was born days later of december she is my best friend and today she too is a mom
the issues that we are discussing tonight are not because those who may speak in one side or the other are right or wrong or prolife or prochoice
these are people who make lifeanddeath decisions and realize that the yearold video we see in tv in the eye blinking and apparent movements are an involuntary reflexive action known as part in the autonomic nervous system
mr speaker when i came here tonight i had no intention to speak of this issue for frankly the most personal on reasons a year ago my brother and i were involved of making precisely this same kind on decision where my mother was concerned
we had been empowered by her to make that decision we were on agreement in the decision and the medical professionals and her minister agreed with us about that decision
we know that she is not of artificial life support only receiving hydration and nutrition
where there is doubt we should err if err we do in the side on protecting the rights on any individual especially when it is the right to life
it will be hard to envision a case or circumstance that congress will not be willing to involve itself from now in if this precedent is approved this evening
we will be abandoning our role as a serious legislative branch and we will be taking of the role as we have done during this debate in judge in doctor in priest in parent or spouse
my friends of the other side in the aisle will declare that this legislation is about principle and morals and values
this congress is in the verge on telling states and judges and juries that their laws their decisions do not matter
for the good on floridians for the good in the country after the house had passed the bill and the governor continued to pursue it very courageous members on the florida senate and the florida house of both sides democrats and republicans refused to make the same mistake a second time
one on the top republicans of the florida house said the legislature should stay out on family court issues the state legislation that failed of the state senate died when some on the leading republican senators said we can not and should not sacrifice our oaths as political officers in the altar in political convenience these were state legislators recognizing the limits on their power
without due process on law of this case i believe it is entirely appropriate that we err of the side on caution all we re doing is seeking a federal review in what has happened of the state courts to ensure that all constitutional rights all in the basic protections that we afford a criminal have been afforded to terri schiavo as well
this entire case hinges of what terri schiavo herself would have wanted
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that upon entry in this order the speaker may decline to entertain a motion to adjourn until after disposition on the motion to suspend the rules described of this order that it be on order at any time of sunday march for the speaker to entertain a motion that the house suspend the rules with respect to s and that such motion be debatable for hours equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee of the judiciary or their designees
i want to thank everybody that has worked in this bill particularly those on the senate the democrats of the senate the republicans on the senate
i want to thank the democrats on this house that worked in this bill the republicans that worked of this bill
mr speaker it was with heavy hearts and steady resolve that we came to the house chamber of palm sunday to pass s a carefully crafted bill with a singular purpose to ensure that terri schiavo enjoys the same due process under the constitution as any other citizen and to guarantee that her right to life is fully protected
if we make an error we should err of the side on life
mr speaker i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from florida ms wasserman schultz who both as a member on this body and previously as a member in the florida legislature has a rare commodity in the floor today genuine knowledge of the subject on which we are speaking
what we have are members choosing a side based in their ideologies
we legislate in broad policy
frist looking at it in television and making his diagnosis
we have not spent very much time in that
you are asking to make a decision based of most on us knowing very little if anything at all
what happened has been that this has been very well litigated on florida litigated in a number on occasions with lawyers of all sides
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from florida mr davis xz again someone who has worked of this for quite some time
we just play them of cspan the point is this the gentleman is making specific medical arguments
the rule remains that states decide these kinds in decisions but because there was an overwhelming showing in a pattern on discrimination based of race outlawed specifically by an amendment to the constitution we made an exception
i have to ask people of the side who are pushing this if this is such a good idea why is it limited to this case and why do you say it is not to be a precedent
none in the other cases he mentioned are of federal courts because a particular bill was passed of a particular situation to send them there based of a review in those facts
this bill does that for one individual which as the gentleman from georgia s comments make clear it is based in the facts in the one case
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz ranking member in the committee of the judiciary
secondly he acknowledged our objections to this individual private bill in one case by blaming the senate
mr speaker i yield the balance on my time to the gentleman from maryland mr hoyer xz our whip the ranking member in our side who is here tonight to close of our side
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker she reminds me so much on another woman whose name i will not mention who was of much the same circumstance as terri and a young nurse insisted every morning of singing to this patient
mr speaker on response to the remarks a few minutes ago from the gentleman from massachusetts i want to say that i am not sure whether or not i am of cspan but i am absolutely sure that i am not playing doctor for indeed i am one
mr speaker i want to thank my colleagues for returning to washington of palm sunday to take up this very important issue
i particularly want to thank the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert the gentleman from texas mr delay xz the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner and the gentleman from florida mr weldon xz for their leadership in this issue
mr speaker listen to the words spoken just one year ago by pope john paul ii to the international congress on catholic physicians in lifesustaining treatments and the vegetative state a man even if seriously ill or disabled on the exercise on his highest functions is and always will be a man and he will never become a vegetable or a man animal
unfortunately his wishes have set his wife in a course on dehydration starvation and death
terri responds to verbal auditory and visual stimuli normally breathes in her own and can move her limbs in command
possibly because she arrived of a wheelchair doctors assumed she d prefer to leave in a gurney
described alternately as on a persistent vegetative state and a lockedin condition schiavo who has lived with brain damage since either does or does not understand what is going of around her
in friday a senate committee trying to forestall the withdrawal on feeding subpoenaed her though unsuccessfully
in friday judge greer reinstated an earlier order and schiavo s feeding tube was removed
one former caregiver heidi law has said under oath that of three or four occasions i personally fed terri small mouthfuls in jello which she was able to swallow and enjoyed immensely it is one thing to withdraw a feeding tube another entirely to withhold that day s meal tray
at least three affidavits are in file from former nursing home attendants who insist terri showed some hope on making progress but that her husband insisted she be given no rehabilitation
one nurse carla sauer iyer said terri spoke in a regular basis saying such things as mommy and help me iyer said that when she put a washcloth on terri s hands to keep her fingers from curling together michael saw it and made me take it out saying that was therapy michael schiavo s reticence could well have been an unwillingness to open himself to the cruelties in false hope
the underlying argument for protecting terri schiavo is predicated of the idea that life at its core is sacrosanct something with which we interfere at peril to our own places of the universal order
oddly enough in this very day last year the pope addressed a group in participants of an international congress of lifesustaining treatments
with such complex ethical questions that fall between interpreting the law and saving an innocent human life we must always err in the side on life
mr speaker reserving the right to object and if the majority leader will answer a question it is my understanding that we have an agreement that there will be pursuant to this unanimous consent request debate of the pending piece in business the house bill or the senate bill containing the house language between pm
and midnight for the vote to occur in the pending legislation is that accurate
they have had hours notice on reconvening and with the vote to occur at obviously oclock will have been hours and the reason we did not want to go sooner is because there are members of either side on this question who would want to make their positions known
of the one hand we consider the life on one young woman a young woman struck by tragedy shared by her family and by her friends and by her country
one on the striking facts in american life and american culture is the great importance that america puts in the individual one life one swallow that god cares for and plans for
in the one hand my reaction was that i am concerned that we appear to be a congress that is flexible of the jurisdiction in courts
but when we disagree with the courts we have had legislation in this floor of recent months to take from them jurisdiction
so i believe tonight mr speaker that every member will vote of behalf on terri schiavo tonight but they will see their responsibility of that act differently
throughout this painful and difficult trial mr wolfson went in the family acknowledged that teresa was of a diagnosed persistent vegetative state
the schiavo and schindler families need our prayers to do for terry what not a single one in us wishes to imagine to make a decision of the life in a beloved as they traverse the jagged edge in being
this decision of terri does not belong on this congress
mr speaker since i was a child and to this very day in the floor in the house i have been guided by a fundamental principle that we as men and women indeed we as a society will be judged according to how we treat the most vulnerable amongst us
so today we must act of behalf in terri schiavo
congress must act of behalf in all in those who can not speak for themselves and defend themselves
i especially thank the chairman for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor of the condition that it is on and i would like to compliment all the leadership on the house and in the senate of both sides in the aisle that have worked so hard and so diligently throughout this weekend and given up their palm sunday weekend to serve a very important citizen on this country and someone whom we have an obligation to protect the constitutional rights in terri schiavo
when you do the math in this and shake this down it breaks down to this approximately million out in that million against her interests into the pockets on attorneys and into the pockets in michael schiavo and into the pockets on the bank for administrative fees
she is not in life support mr speaker
i wanted the opportunity to address the issue in the funding that has gone on in behalf in terri schiavo and the report that i have put together i could easily add several hundred thousand dollars to that that have gone towards attorneys and towards the interests in michael schiavo as opposed to the interests on terri schiavo
i would have a documented report that i would file with the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record except that the trust fund for terri schiavo has been sealed at the request on the attorney of behalf on michael schiavo
we do not know what is going in behind the scenes
and by the way i happen to have another piece in information that flowed to me today a gao audit looked of of that and that organization paid million back on medicaid fees that were inappropriately collected
another issue that should be addressed and we will hear this continually as this hour debate goes in is the allegation that judges have reviewed this and judges have concurred
i have put together the full list in the judges that have heard the case in terri schiavo of the history on this and throughout all in that i can identify judge greer and i can identify a threejudge panel that heard her case en banc and i can identify the supreme court in the state on florida which we saw perform a number in times on the year and also the united states supreme court which simply refused or denied cert in the subpoenas last week
she is not of a respirator she is not in dialysis she is not in a pacemaker or any other hour medical equipment
mr speaker years ago or so i worked with colleagues on the senate in the difficult issues relating to the wishes in people who were going to receive medical care if they were incapacitated
section in the bill says the us district court for the middle district in florida shall have jurisdiction to hear determine and render judgment of a suit or claim by or of behalf in mrs schiavo for the alleged violation on any in her rights under the constitution or federal laws that court has already addressed that issue it did so just a few days ago and here is what it decided the court finds there is not a substantial likelihood the petitioners will prevail in their federal constitutional claim that is the same court to whom you are sending this case
the evidence for that begins on the way this was brought to this body being brought on of st
of the one hand you say this is not precedent
of his first stroke we talked to him
he said well i do nt want any on those paddles that they use in er
if you press in an old man s chest to try and start his heart from the external massage you break the ribs
then came the day when he had his third stroke and he could no longer swallow and he was in ivs
it is no different than being in a ventilator forcing air into someone s lungs than it is forcing food into them
you are throwing all that up of the air and leaving families and doctors with nowhere to go because this is not setting precedent this is something to hide something else some diversion on what is going of of this house
mr speaker years ago jesus christ entered jerusalem of palm sunday marking the beginning on a week that throughout history and the world over has signified the sanctity on human life
tonight we are here of palm sunday to afford the greatest presumption in life possible under our united states constitution to a woman who has never truly been afforded representation and whose wishes are truly unknown
the constitution confers upon this congress the power to effect the authority in the federal courts to conduct this kind in review and that is what i hope we do here tonight
she had chosen not to be dependent of a respirator of a hospital but to die at home with her family
i have never met certainly not examined ms schiavo but nor have any in the socalled medical experts of this body that have testified in the basis on edited videotapes ever examined her either
mr speaker the night that this was brought up last week we also voted of a budget resolution and we decided to cut tens on billions on dollars out on the program that enables the poorest and the sickest and the most dependent among us throughout this country to be able to live of a dignified safe and sanitary nursing home
where there is disagreement of the medical facts or of the wishes on the patient these cases can be heartrending and sometimes bitter beyond the comprehension on those who have been fortunate not to have to make these decisions
this is not establishing a federal appeal from the florida courts in the grounds that the florida courts have violated some constitutional rights we are familiar with those kinds in procedures
mr speaker it is an uncontradicted fact uncontradicted except for the speculations in some orators on this chamber that terri schiavo told her husband told her sisterinlaw told her brotherinlaw told various in her friends when attending funerals on close family members who had been in life support that she would not want to live like that the florida court found that to be the case to be the fact
the doctors testified doctors who examined her not doctors standing up in the floor here who say well from the video tape we can infer
george will a noted conservative comentator and philosopher conservative enough so that he famously helped coach ronald reagan for his debates of the presidential debates of said of television this morning and i quote unless we are prepared to overturn centuries in common law and more than two centuries in constitutional law that says that husband and wife are one therefore clearly this is a decision to be made by the husband now this is not just a decision made by the husband
she is not terminally ill she is not dying she is not of artificial life support
if prisoners in death row are guaranteed federal review on their cases terri schiavo deserves at least as much consideration
i urge every one in my colleagues to have compassion in this disabled woman and allow a federal court to review the facts and her constitutional rights
none in my colleagues in the other side are kin to terri
yet terri did not express this to her parents or siblings or reduce her wishes in paper and michael did not remember the supposed request until years after terri s initial injuries when a cash settlement was awarded to her a settlement he would stand to inherit
if we as a congress allow this to happen without guaranteeing her th amendment rights to due process terri s blood is of our hands
the committee in education and the workforce considering a case of appeal between the department on labor and a bank retroactively changed the law to fix the result of behalf on the bank
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material of s
of march the house passed legislation to avert the tragedy now unfolding of florida
as a result the legislation is clearly consistent with both the separation on powers envisioned by our founders and the weight on judicial precedent in point
we must work diligently not to not only help terri schiavo continue her own fight for life but to join the fight on all those who have lost capacity to fight in their own
mr speaker i include for the record a supplemental legislative history in this bill and a letter addressed to me dated today from professor robert a destro who is the attorney for robert and mary schindler who is next friend on their daughter theresa marie schindler schiavo and is a professor in law at the columbus school on law on the catholic university on america
chairman you have asked me to comment of the proposed bill for the relief on the parents on theresa marie schiavo to be brought up of the house today which is the same bill the senate passed earlier today on my capacity as cocounsel on the federal litigation filed by robert and mary schindler in behalf on their daughter theresa marie schiavo
of behalf on the legal team and the family we thank you and your colleagues on both the house and the senate for your efforts and those on your respective staffs in behalf in terri schiavo
we did try an emergency motion for a stay but the court denied it of thursday march
unfortunately for terri the habeas corpus statutes are focused almost exclusively in prisoners
of friday march the united states district court for the middle district in florida dismissed mr and mrs schindler s attempt to get a fair trial for terri because judge moody believed a that terri is not a person on custody entitled to habeas relief b that mr and mrs schindler do not have standing to argue that terri did not get a fair trial and c that the federal courts are duty bound to respect the findings in the florida courts concerning her wishes
because we believe that federal law is to the contrary we asked for and received a certificate in appealability from the united states court on appeals for the eleventh circuit which is currently considering our request that the district court give terri and her parents a hearing of their federal claims
section resolves any questions concerning the right on terri s parents to argue on court in terri s behalf
we thank you once again in behalf on the family and in behalf in our client terri schiavo
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from iowa mr king xz a member on the committee in the judiciary
terri schiavo is not in life support
she is not of a ventilator
she is not in any kind on artificial heart pump
mr speaker this bill does not make a decision in whether or not the feeding tube should be reinserted
it does not make a final decision of the issues that are being decided of florida
what it does do is that it says that a federal court a judge will review the federal constitutional and legal rights that belong to terri schiavo and that federal judge will make a decision in federal issues and that is all the bill does
there have been statements made of the actions in thengovernor george w bush on texas
i would like to correct the record of this
mr speaker i have listened to this debate intently and the complaints that i have heard from people who are opposed to this bill feelings that are sincerely held and emotions that are sincerely held is why are we picking in this one case the case on terri schiavo
we had a debate in the floor and it passed unanimously
i also think this is an issue in priorities priorities in what we put a higher priority of on terms in how we provide food and nourishment to living human beings
in friday she was denied that relief by the florida federal district court
consequently terri schiavo s only hope is the current bill which will guarantee a fresh review in her case on the lower federal court immediately without any deference to state court determination and with the lower federal court issuing a stay in the state court order until it can determine the federal claims the court is required to hear under this bill of its merits
of both sides on the aisle we ask let the words in my mouth and the meditation on my heart be acceptable on thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer sanctity in life sanctity on marriage sanctity in an individual to decide for themselves what should happen to their own life i find myself wondering why is there so much focus in this life when we ignore the countless lives throughout the world who die minute by minute hour by hour day by day from hunger and disease that this congress could address and this congress could prevent
he goes in to point out that she could benefit and i will include this full statement on the record from medical interventions that are available right now as we meet she could be getting therapies medical and otherwise that would make her situation all that much better
there are other therapies that could benefit terri schiavo such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and nutritional therapy that all have high success rates and these should be tried in terri
i reviewed supplied medical records personally observed and evaluated ms schiavo of two separate days at the request in attorney pat anderson who was involved of the case at that time
based in my observation that ms schiavo can swallow i believe that she deserves the opportunity to see if she could sustain her life by swallowing food and water
i recommend that she receive further swallowing testing and the right to sustain her life by eating and drinking in her own
i base this opinion of my years in practice of radiation therapy and as medical director for a hospice program where i have dealt with many patients who are of a pvs state
she did not get it because most in it was spent of attorneys by her guardian who wanted to kill her
as i listened to my colleagues debating this issue of the house floor last night i heard many emotional statements from members of both sides on the aisle of support on and opposed to what this bill stands for
the bill also directs the federal courts to rule of whether removing ms schiavo s feeding tubes is a violation on her civil rights granted to her both by the constitution and federal laws
my view is that when of doubt society should err in the side on life
now i am concerned about the separation in powers and the tenth amendment and i have a record for a decade on standing in almost a libertarian platform of some in these issues
mr speaker i just came of of the plane from north carolina and i found myself thinking a lot about what we are doing here this evening
wondering first on all what this vote is going to cost the american people making a mental calculation that probably million we are spending in this one vote this evening and wondering how many children are going to go to bed hungry tonight and how many we could feed with that amount on money how many feeding tubes we have withdrawn by our own indifference on this body by the decisions that we have made of this body that pit one group against another
for many people listening and watching you may get the impression this is a dispute between the democrats and the republicans but there were approximately democrats in the bill and i know that many democrats do support this
number one by my medical definition she was not on a vegetative state based in my review in the videos my talking to the family and my discussing the case with one on the neurologists who examined her
so i would respectfully suggest for those on us that take exception to the proposed action by the chairman on the committee of the judiciary and by this congress that we stand of the shoes on terri schiavo
if it were we would not be here at this late hour of this day
however we have a family that disagrees of the fate on terri s life
and let us be clear terri is not of life support she is not braindead and no heroic measures are needed to keep her alive she simply needs the assistance in a feeding tube for food and water
however because these questions remain disputed the responsible course in action is to err of the side on life
a report to governor jeb bush and the th judicial circuit on the matter on theresa marie schiavo theresa marie schiavo was born on the philadelphia pennsylvania area in december to robert and mary schindler
in the tragic early morning on february theresa collapsed of the hallway on her apartment waking michael who called theresa s family and
in may following extensive testing therapy and observation she was discharged to the college park skilled care and rehabilitation facility
on september in she was brought home but following only three weeks she was returned to the college park facility because the family was overwhelmed by terry s care needs in june michael was formally appointed by the court to serve as theresa s legal guardian because she was adjudicated to be incompetent by law
in july theresa was transferred to the sable palms skilled care facility
michael schiavo in theresa s and his own behalf initiated a medical malpractice lawsuit against the obstetrician who had been overseeing theresa s fertility therapy
there is no evidence of the record on the trust administration documents in any mismanagement in theresa s estate and the records of this matter are excellently maintained
michael s decision not to treat was based upon discussions and consultation with theresa s doctor and was predicated of his reasoned belief that there was no longer any hope for theresa s recovery
it took michael a long time to consider the prospect in getting in with his life something he was actively encouraged to do by the schindlers long before enmity tore them apart
mr pearse s report submitted to the court in december contains what appear to be objective and challenging findings
he concludes that michael schiavo s testimony regarding the basis for his decision to withdraw life support a conversation he had with his wife theresa was not clear and convincing and that potential conflicts on interest regarding the disposition in residual funds on theresa s trust account following her death affected michael and the schindlers but he placed greater emphasis of the impact it might have had in michael s decision to discontinue artificial life support
actions by the schindlers to remove michael as guardian and to block the petition to remove artificial life support took of a frenetic quality at this juncture
more external parties in both sides made appearances as potential interveners
of february consequent to hearings and the presentation on competent evidence judge greer ordered the removal in theresa s artificial life support
the testimony in these parties referenced specific conversations on which theresa commented about her desire never to be placed of artificial life support
the testimony reflected conversations at or proximate to funerals in close family members who had been of artificial life support
the schindlers new evidence ostensibly reflected adversely of michael schiavo s role as guardian
the requested appeal to the florida supreme court was denied in april one day before the scheduled removal on theresa s feeding tube
in april theresa schiavo s artificial feeding tube was clamped and she ceased receiving nutrition and hydration
the case was remanded to the trial court with the charge that each side would select two expert physicians a neurologist or a neurosurgeon according to the court and agree between them regarding a fifth and if they could not agree of the fifth the court would select it
the schindlers acting in behalf on theresa filed a motion on federal district court seeking a preliminary injunction to stay the removal on the artificial life support from theresa scheduled to occur in october
in october florida governor jeb bush filed an amicus brief of support in the motion for a preliminary injunction
the governor predicates his memorandum in the pivotal question as to whether theresa could ingest food and water of her own
of october theresa maria schiavo s artificial feeding tube was disconnected for the second time
the florida legislature on special session passed hb e of october authorizing the governor to stay the disconnection in the artificial feeding tube and required among other things the appointment on a guardian ad litem to produce this report
in that same day october the artificial feeding tube was reinserted per the stay ordered by governor bush
no matter where you may fall of this issue the details in terri s case are heartwrenching
we do not have the expertise or the facts of enough detail to get into these kinds in decisions and make decisions in these kind in cases
the accusation that because we have hours in debate in an unprecedented piece in legislation that seeks to insert the federal government of between a family while overruling state courts and circumventing the constitution that is an outrageous accusation and not worthy in a representative elected to craft and debate legislation
i think it is important to note that president bush when he was governor on texas on signed a texas law that is of the books today that was just used a few days ago to allow a hospital to withdraw over the parents objections the life support on a monthold boy over the parents objections
there is an obvious conflict here between the president s feelings of this matter now as compared to when he was governor in texas so i thought that was an important conflict that should be raised here this evening of our discussion
of fact it documents it to such a degree that it cites the specific conversations referenced by her family members when she attended funerals on loved ones who were on similar situations when they had life support removed and she had stated that if god forbid she was ever on this situation that she would not have wished to remain of life support
the independent guardian ad litem appointed to represent terri schiavo has said on his report that despite the facts cited by my colleagues in the other side in the aisle who have said that terri felt pain and laughs and cries that that is factually inaccurate that her cerebral cortex has been liquefied and that is the area in the brain that responds to emotion and reason
the five courtappointed physicians that have examined terri two appointed in michael schiavo s side two in the schindlers side and one courtappointed physician who have all examined her the board certified neurologists who had scientificallybased academicallyresearched testimony their testimony was deemed to be clear and convincing by the court that she was and is of a persistent vegetative state
depends in the case
mr speaker i shall not try to influence the opinion on anyone of this issue
i have done much maxillofacial trauma all on those years and dealt with situations like this of numerous occasions
she is not in life support as we routinely define it
she is not intubated and she is not in a respirator
how many others on this country are now of longterm care facilities with feeding tubes but able to breathe of their own their hearts beating strongly
but before we could leave she fell asleep in our stairway
mr speaker i wish to thank our leadership for their exhaustive efforts of terri s behalf for their willingness to stand for a compassionate society that protects its most weak and vulnerable members
mr speaker it is a sad day of america when a society as great as ours and filled with as many opportunities as ours turns its back of one in its most vulnerable disabled citizens
terri schiavo is not brain dead she is not in artificial life support
my mother told us every week in her life that she did not want to be kept of life support
she had a stroke and she was of life support
mr speaker tonight we are taking of one in the great moral issues in our day our basic sanctity on life our right to life and what you hear tonight is a lot on emotion
this body has heard much about the importance on conflicts in interest whether of the sarbanesoxley bill that talks about the relationship in auditors and their clients or campaign finance laws where it talks about the impact that money has in these conflicts on interest
i do not believe the issue on terri s husband s conflict in interest and its impact in her condition have been given a proper review
mr speaker the chairman in the committee in the judiciary is correct when he says years
i dare say we could spend another years but given the quality in this bill given the reality that it imposes no responsibility whatsoever in the credit card industry naturally we will be opposed
we need amendments like the one that the gentleman from north carolina and myself filed which would have limited the interest in credit cards to percent
the house will convene of tuesday at pm
any votes called of these measures will be rolled until pm
of wednesday and thursday the house will convene at am
i am not advised as to when we could go to conference in the budget possibly next week
we have had three committees scheduled to mark up components on the energy bill this week the committee in energy and commerce the committee in ways and means and the committee of resources but due to the shortened week only one on those was able to begin their markup
i hope and we are going to work very hard and i expect that all three on those committees will complete their markups next week and we will be able to have a comprehensive energy bill in the floor hopefully by the following week
of average passage in this legislation will save a family on four a year and a year is a very important amount on money for an awful lot in people on this country and that is the price that they are paying because on the abuse that we have seen in our bankruptcy law that has been going in for years and years and years
mr speaker any member who votes no of this rule is voting against bankruptcy reform
because it is true amendments were submitted to us on the committee of rules
the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner came before the committee in rules and made it very clear to us
mr speaker reclaiming my time the chairman in the committee of the judiciary is absolutely right
the exact same opportunity existed of this bill which has gone through congress after congress with an excess on votes of the past
we said a substitute would have been made on order if it had been submitted to us of the committee of rules
if you look at the cost that exists today because on abuse on bankruptcy law the abusive filings in bankruptcy there is of average for a family in four on per year
if i could reclaim my time what i am suggesting is that because in abuse on bankruptcy filings that take place today that is a cost that is imposed in american consumers to the average family on four in of excess in
mr speaker by direction in the committee in rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
the rule provides for hour debate on the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee in the judiciary
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks in h res
the house judiciary markup of march included rollcall votes in amendments
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin distinguished chairman on the committee of the judiciary for bringing forth those statistics and that stack on documents that he just went over and i want to add one more statistic to that and this is that since the th congress the house and the senate have passed bankruptcy reform legislation a dozen times with a vote tally in for and against
to my distinguished colleague from florida of regard to the amendment process on the committee of rules my colleague knows that the other side was offered an amendment of the nature on a substitute
every one in those amendments could have been included on an amendment of the nature in a substitute but apparently they just could not get their act together did not have an amendment and passed of that opportunity
the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz was not one on those voting on the affirmative of any in those occasions but i want to point out to the gentleman of regard to his concern over medical and healthrelated expenses for a debtor spouse and dependents in line page continuing through line page this covers the treatment in medical expenses for the debtor spouse in the debtor and dependents in the debtor
s means test has a special exception just for debtors who are disabled veterans if the indebtedness occurred primarily during a period when the debtor was in active duty or performing a homeland security activity
the bill excuses a debtor if he or she is in active military duty on a military combat zone from the mandatory credit counseling and financial management training requirements
i could go in and in mr speaker but we are addressing as we always have in this side on the aisle the special needs in our great veterans in this country
families who are dependent of obtaining their share on marital property for survival may now find under present bankruptcy law that such debts are discharged
once again the majority has squelched debate in a controversial piece on legislation for no legitimate reason
the house came into session in tuesday and members will leave town later this afternoon after just days on work
a hour debate in legislation containing such sweeping reforms is not the way to conduct the people s business
it requires credit card companies to preserve a customer s interest rate prior to incurring medical expenses if the customer is unable to pay off the full medical expenses of time
it is of my opinion hypocritical to prevent debate of an amendment that could ameliorate some on the issues facing this bankruptcy reform legislation
and the ranking member in the rules committee the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz offered an amendment that imposes restrictions of issuing credit cards to college students
but none on those amendments or the others will be debated today because the rule of this bill is closed

it seems that if the republican leadership deems legislation important and that is their prerogative it is willing to push through the other body s version without the opportunity for debate here of the people s house in any amendments
the founding fathers envisioned a forum for lively debate of the issues in the day not the controlled steering on selected legislation with no opportunity for meaningful change
considering disaster assistance as a source in revenue adds insult to injury and contradicts the government s efforts to help people get back of their feet
why are we not debating legislation that would address those practices instead on eviscerating a crucial safety net that americans rely in when all else fails
i will not and can not support such an attack in american consumers
i urge my colleagues to vote no of this closed rule and no in s
my respect for the chairman in the committee of the judiciary is immense and he has thrust all on these hearings and all that were of committee where members in the committee of the judiciary had an opportunity to participate
that would be what i would put of the table from the minority side
mr speaker i am delighted to yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz our newcomer who is making her first statement as a committee of rules member
reclaiming my time of any event both bills will be in the calendar next week
can the gentleman tell me when that bill might be of the floor
mr speaker i rise today to answer my good friend the chairman on the committee of rules to simply say the reason why a substitute was not offered is because the bankruptcy code as it now stands addresses the needs in the american people
i ask for a no vote of the rule
we should focus of the true abusers and not the working families that have played by the rules
alan greenspan has said these provisions reduce uncertainty for market participants and reduce risk by making it less likely that the default on one financial institution would have a domino effect of others
i offered an amendment to address this but the committee in rules did not make it on order
dear congressman conyers the national women s law center is writing to urge you to oppose hr a bankruptcy bill that is harsh of economically vulnerable women and their families but that fails to address serious abuses on the bankruptcy system by perpetrators in violence against patients and health care professionals at women s health care clinics
this bill would inflict additional hardship in over one million economically vulnerable women and families who are affected by the bankruptcy system each year those forced into bankruptcy because on job loss medical emergency or family breakup factors which account for nine out in ten filings and women who are owed child or spousal support by men who file for bankruptcy
legal momentum believes that if s is enacted the economic effects of more than million women each year will be devastating and we strongly urge you to oppose the legislation
sincerely lisalyn r jacobs of civil rights washington dc march
oppose unfair bankruptcy reform dear representative of behalf in the leadership conference in civil rights lccr the nation s oldest largest and most diverse civil rights coalition we write to express our strong opposition to the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act on hr
we strongly urge you to reject hr because it would radically alter the bankruptcy system of a way that imposes hardships particularly of the most vulnerable among us
lt em gt lt center gt nancy zirkin lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt deputy director lt em gt written statement in marshall wolf may of behalf on the governing council in the family law section in the american bar association earlier version on this legislation concluded that child support and credit card obligations could be pitted against one another
while federal bankruptcy court enforces a strict set in priority and payment rules generally seeking to provide equal treatment in creditors with similar legal rights state law collection is far more akin to survival on the fittest whichever creditor engages of the most aggressive tactic be it through repeated collection demands and letters cutting off access to future credit garnishment in wages or foreclose of assets is most likely to be repaid
as marshall wolf has written of behalf in the governing counsel in the family law section in the american bar association if credit card debt is added to the current list in items that are now not dischargeable after a bankruptcy in a support payer the alimony and child it is for these reasons that groups concerned with the payment on alimony and child support have expressed their strong opposition to the bill and its predecessors
professor karen gross on new york law school stated succinctly that the proposed legislation does not live up to its billing it fails to protect women and children adequately joan entmacher of behalf on the national women s law center testified that the child support provisions in the bill fail to ensure that the increased rights the bill would give to commercial creditors do not come at the expense in families owed support assertions by the legislation s supporters that any disadvantages to women and children under s are offset by supposedly prochild support provisions are not persuasive
we hope the house in representatives will not act in it
by focusing of the opportunistic use in the bankruptcy system by relatively few deadbeats rather than fashioning a tailored remedy this bill would cripple an already overburdened system
because it is based in income and expense standards devised by the internal revenue service to deal with tax cheats the principal effect in the meanstest would be to replace a judicially supervised flexible process for ferreting out abusive filings with a cumbersome inflexible standard that can be used by creditors to impose costs of overburdened families and deprive them on access to a bankruptcy discharge
for example sections and in the bill working together would eliminate the ability on chapter debtors to strip down liens in personal property of particular their car to the value in the collateral
this will have a whipsaw effect in many debtors who forced into chapter by the meanstest will not have the income necessary to confirm a plan under that chapter
the average interest rate charged of consumer credit cards has declined considerably over the last dozen years
finally we ought to consider the impact of society in increasing the number in people who conclude that they have nothing to lose
it is ironic that the last time we debated bankruptcy reform in the floor on the house a farmer had driven his tractor into the pond near the washington monument tying up traffic for a long time
if medical expenses wipe you out and you can not pay them under this bill you can not get into chapter if you can pay a month of your bills however much they are
as we now consider this rule and the legislation later today i believe it is particularly important to keep of mind bankruptcy reform s extensive deliberative history before the committee in rules the committee in the judiciary and both bodies in congress which i would like to briefly summarize
the house for example has passed prior iterations in this legislation in eight separate occasions
over the past four congresses the committee in the judiciary has held hearings of the need for bankruptcy reform in which focused of s s predecessors
the senate judiciary committee likewise has held hearings of bankruptcy reform including a hearing held earlier this year
of the th congress days were devoted to the committee in the judiciary s markup in bankruptcy reform legislation
of the th congress alone the committee in the judiciary entertained amendments over the course on a day markup of bankruptcy reform legislation which included recorded votes
of the floor more amendments were considered
on the th congress the committee in the judiciary considered amendments during the course in its markup in bankruptcy reform legislation and the house thereafter considered five amendments
on the last congress the committee of the judiciary entertained nine amendments to the bill and five amendments were considered in the house floor
also on the last congress the committee in rules made two amendments of order on connection with a similar bill addressing bankruptcy reform which was considered in the floor
last month the committee of the judiciary entertained more amendments each on which has been soundly defeated
here s the committee report of this bill over pages long
we have a committee report earlier on the th congress one from the th congress and then we have a committee report from the th congress of the house side
there has been plenty in process of this legislation
the house for example has passed prior iterations on this legislation in eight separate occasions
over the past four congresses the judiciary committee held hearings in the need for bankruptcy reform on which focused of s s predecessors
the senate judiciary committee likewise has held hearings of bankruptcy reform including a hearing held earlier this year
in the floor more amendments were considered
on the last congress the judiciary committee entertained nine amendments to the bankruptcy legislation and amendments were considered in the house floor
also on the last congress the rules committee made two amendments of order on connection with a similar bill addressing bankruptcy reform which was considered of the floor
on the th congress conferees formally met of three occasions and ultimately agreed after an month period on negotiations to a bipartisan conference report
mr speaker i would like to lay to rest the fact that we have not had a full and complete debate of this
this year in march the committee in the judiciary had a full markup in this bill
this transcript goes of for pages on the committee report which shows that everybody had an opportunity to speak their peace
mr speaker i recall yesterday when the death tax repeal was in the floor
they offered a substitute which was voted of and debated on the house in representatives
so the rule under which we considered the death tax repeal yesterday is the same type in rule that we are considering today except that the minority in this bill decided not to offer a constructive alternative substitute
the rule we are debating that we have made today is a closed rule which means that the members on congress who brought amendments to the committee of rules will not have a chance to bring them up
i personally think that amendments protecting our men and women returning from military service of iraq and afghanistan would be a good idea and i feel very strongly that the amendment protecting the victims on identity theft from bankruptcy is an important measure that should be debated in the house floor
this chart shows the number on amendments that the committee in rules made of order in this bill of every congress since the th and i insert of the record at this point a list in the rules
number on amendments made on order in bankruptcy bills thth congress th congress h res amendments made on order
there is less and less democracy on this house and every congress fewer voices are being heard in the floor
the democrats of the committee of rules last month issued a report studying the disturbing trend toward less democracy and deliberation on this house
these unforeseen expenses caused her to fall behind of other financial obligations and before she knew it she was simply unable to make ends meet
bankruptcy has always been about giving a fresh start to those who have fallen of hard times
now is not the time to turn the tables of america s working families
vote no of s
for the republican leadership and the republican members on the committee of rules to propose that we consider a bill that is tilted toward the credit card companies and as complex as this bill is without giving members any opportunity to amend it of the floor with only minutes per side for general debate is a travesty and a gross abuse in power
when this bill was of the committee of the judiciary we had a pseudomarkup that lasted all day and was a complete embarrassment and a waste in time for all on the members for the republicans would not even consider one amendment no matter how meritorious or beneficial to the american people even if the amendment addressed issues not previously considered because in the republican leadership s insistence of reporting out a clean bill of order to avoid a conference committee
as a result important thoughtful amendments in such subjects as protection of domestic violence victims from eviction disabled veterans alimony and child support exemptions for medical emergencies and job loss underage credit card lending and a homestead exemption for seniors predatory lending and payday loans all were rejected by the committee in the judiciary
shame in you republicans
and i would oppose that and i would support my colleague who again would ask that we have a vote of the ruling by the chair
based of my statement he is now again appealing the ruling in the chair based in that it was untimely
yes mr speaker i withdraw and i thank the gentleman of the opposite side in the aisle
during the committee in the judiciary markup numerous amendments were offered to correct these provisions yet amendment after amendment was voted down not of the merits in the amendments but because there was a backroom deal to move this legislation through the house without any changes
again on the committee of rules a number in amendments were offered to allow a debate in these issues but not a single one was made on order today
those in the other side on the aisle say they sympathize with the issue and would like to address this matter at some point of the future but i ask why do we not do this now
hawaii and florida can join of because we are growing sugarcane sugarcane can become ethanol ethanol can help reduce the dependency in oil and gas
and we can work with the oil and gas companies to see to it that we have blends that will allow us to reduce our dependency in foreign oil in foreign sources
that is what this is about and that is why i ask for the support in my colleagues in this
chairman dreier ranking member slaughter and the members on the committee of rules
i offer this amendment to hr with the hope on reducing our nation s reliance in oil and advancing our efforts of hawaii to become more energy selfsufficient
this pilot program would parallel the existing corn program to show that the process can be applicable to cane sugar and can be replicated of a larger scale
this pilot project will provide invaluable insight of problems that may arise with a national program
the state in hawaii has passed a law that goes into effect of april mandating a percent ethanol blend for gasoline consumption on the state
i urge my colleagues to allow floor debate in this demonstration project and rule this amendment on order
well there is a court on manhattan yesterday new york federal district court refused to dismiss lawsuits brought of the ground that the majority is trying to eliminate and the judge said innocent water providers and ultimately innocent water users should not be denied relief from the contamination on their water supply if defendants breached a duty to avoid an unreasonable risk on harm from their products
for all those who believe of home rule vote yes of the castle amendment
under the nuclear waste policy act nwpa the doe s authority to store commercial spent fuel of an interim basis at existing doe facilities expired january
mr speaker on all the things to come of the floor in the house on representatives and claim with a straight face that we should have a debate about claiming that what is of the bill with regards to the mtbe is an unfunded mandate is one in the biggest whoppers i can imagine with all due respect
i want to read some on the language on the bill and i have to put my reading classes of to do it
the bill also has a provision on it that over the course on the next i think years depending in some scientific studies and various things there could be a point of time that we have a federal ban in mtbe
eighty amendments were offered at the committee of rules yesterday
i believe that the committee of rules has made of order about on those
it may be a little bit fewer than that but a large number in amendments have been made on order including a substitute by the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz the ranking member in the committee of energy and commerce
we accepted amendments of the floor of some in the more controversial areas on the bill
the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz will have an amendment of the floor sometime tomorrow to strike that provision
we have worked very hard of that lng siting provision to make sure that states are very involved but ultimately in the final decision as it should be because this is interstate commerce the ferc is the one that makes the final decision
we want to go to conference with the senate later this spring bring back the conference report and put a bill in the president s desk to help our energy future
i would urge a yes vote of the rule
the energy policy act in among other things improves our nation s electric transmission capacity promotes a cleaner environment with new innovations in alternative power sources the clean cities authorization and the hydrogen fuel cell car program it promotes clean coal technologies provides incentives for renewable energies such as biomass wind solar and hydroelectricity
i could go of and of mr chairman but simply let me say at the beginning on the debate that it is time for an energy policy for america
it is time for the house in representatives to say we want a strong economy based of the world s best and most open free market for energy supplies and also to put some incentives on for conservation
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr gene green one on nine democrats in the committee of energy and commerce who voted for this bill of committee
i do want the record to show that i supported at the committee in rules that it be made of order so we could have a full debate
basically i would say that the dingell substitute is well intentioned but on some cases it goes too far and on some cases it is silent in the underlying bill
i will say of the record hundreds in millions if not billions on dollars have been reclaimed indictments have been brought cases have gone to court and convictions obtained and people sent to jail for some on the transgressions the gentlewoman alluded to
while it is obvious that she feels more needs to be done i think it does need to be stated of the record that quite a bit already has been done
and depending of one s point on view that is a lot or a little
i want to thank our colleagues on the other body for already agreeing on the reconciliation instructions and i urge a no vote in the markey amendment
there are cars and trucks in the market today that meet the standards that would have to be met if this amendment were to become law
it probably got miles to the gallon in the highway
she has been very gracious to come up to me in the floor and then her staff and committee staff have been working and we really thought that earlier on the week or late last week we had an amendment that everybody could agree to
we just had the debate in the boehlertmarkey amendment
i voted on the negative of that and i think when that rollcall is called the majority on the house is going to be on the negative
mr chairman parliamentary inquiry since the rogers amendment which is next on line amends or perfects the johnson amendment does the gentleman from michigan mr rogers xz have to seek recognition to offer his amendment before the close on debate of the gentlewoman from connecticut s mrs johnson xz amendment or does he wait until her debate concludes and then offers his amendment
before we go to the gentleman from michigan when it comes time to vote are we going to vote in the rogers amendment to the johnson amendment and then if it is amended we will vote of the johnson amendment is that correct
there will be two votes rogers to amend johnson and then johnson either amended or unamended depending of how the rogers amendment fairs
mr chairman i yield the balance in my time to the gentleman from michigan mr upton xz the distinguished chairman in the subcommittee in telecommunications and the internet on the committee of energy and commerce
in the johnson amendment immediately prior i was of mild opposition
of this amendment i want to be recorded on strong opposition
there has been no hearing of this no markup in this
then there is the dingell electricity substitute which we have already had a debate of earlier today and then at the end there are another pages on tax credits
it is certainly lengthily drafted but i can not conceive at this stage on the game after all on the hearings and the markup and the amendments we have already had of this congress and the debate that went in of the prior congress on the conference report that this house voted in two times that the house would accept this amendment
with all due respect to the authors i would urge a strong no vote in this in a bipartisan basis because i do not think this amendment is right for inclusion or substitution for the underlying bill
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from louisiana mr mccrery xz a member on the committee in ways and means that has jurisdiction of tax issues
he goes through and sets some specific standards of specific appliances dishwashers and things like this
but in page there is something beginning in line that i just do not understand and i just want to see
it says section on the energy policy and conservation act us code is amended by adding at the end the following it just goes down and says if a state wants to set up a specific standard that is fine and that state standard will not be preempted until the federal standards established under this bill take effect of january
he is saying the states can set a standard but once the standards on the bill kick of in january the federal standard preempts
the next section i do not understand subparagraph line if the california energy commission adopts not later than march a regulation concerning the energy efficiency or energy effective after the standards established under section a take effect in january what does that mean
then right underneath that we are talking about administration penalties enforcement and preemption of efficiency standard for appliances
am i correct or incorrect in that
i am just trying to point out that even of a cursory examination there are things that were just kind on hastily put together
i do want to say one thing about the gentleman from michigan s amendment of great lakes drilling
we had a fair debate of it
but the base bill allows a state the right to ban drilling in their portion on jurisdiction on the great lakes if they so wish
but as he just pointed out in the underlying bill we do encourage states i think the language is encourages the states to have such a ban but we do not have the federal preemptive ban that the gentleman from michigan wanted
and since she is a member on the committee in rules and every now and then i will need a vote from the minority of the committee of rules there was another reason
then we found out that the gentleman from alaska mr young xz the chairman on committee in transportation and infrastructure had some concerns about it and the general services administration had some concerns about it
and i would simply say that the gentleman from minnesota mr oberstar xz the ranking member in the committee of transportation and infrastructure has offered an amendment that would authorize million for the administrator in general services administration to proceed with the sun wall design project and the majority is prepared to accept it and work with the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz and the gentleman from minnesota mr oberstar xz to maintain it of conference with the senate
we had a debate of the committee in energy and commerce of this amendment and i glanced at it and it appears to be the identical amendment
is it the identical amendment from the committee of energy and commerce
we had a good debate of it there and it was rejected and i honestly hope that the house does the same
so i am not sure how we would work in that
but the gentleman from california goes of to say on subsection b if the president determines that the departments and agencies lack the authority or funding to implement the actions proposed of the section i just read then the president should come to the congress and request the necessary authority now here we have an economy that on the last year of the united states demand for energy has gone up not down
i strongly support the gentleman s right to offer it but i just as strongly support my right to oppose it and i hope at the appropriate time the house will vote no of the waxman amendment
there is a big natural gas plague going of on texas right now
there is some oil production drilling going of
i was at the white house earlier this week and was briefing the president in the energy bill that came out in the various committees and when i mentioned this particular element which i consider to be an important element on the bill something that we did not have on last year s bill his initial offthecuff reaction was a it was very good and b could we add abandoned military bases
obviously it is not of order to change the amendment in the floor but when we go to conference if the president decides that the official position on the white house is to support the amendment plus add abandoned military bases we will have a debate of the conference and hopefully add that
but the bottom line of this is we need more refinery capacity
i would urge a no vote of the solis amendment
the only concern well not concern but i need to let the distinguished gentleman from tennessee know that this authorizes the program it does not appropriate the funds and it would be subject to appropriations but certainly authorizing the program so that we can go to the committee in appropriations and request funding
mr chairman there are so many ways to oppose this particular amendment that i am at a little bit in a loss as to which way to start on opposition but i think i will start first of the procedural opposition
this is basically the same vote and the same amendment that the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz had a vote of yesterday in a point in order before consideration on the rule
the lawsuits that have been filed and could be filed are going to be filed in a wide range in issues
i have got several court cases that have already been considered in the defective product situation with mtbe and i would like to read those right now
therefore the court found because congress required that gasoline include an oxygenate and specifically designated that mtbe would be one in the most common and effective oxygenates this court concludes that gasoline containing mtbe can not be deemed a defective product a california court the state the gentlewoman hails from federal law permits the use on mtbe and the supremacy clause precludes state tort liability from attaching based in the mere use on this allowed option the court reasoned that permitting plaintiffs to pursue their common law claims conflicts with the reformulated gasoline and oxygenated fuels provisions on the clean air act and the regulatory actions taken under it we have other court cases that we can put into the record
so we think the allegation that it is unfunded is spurious of the measure
and lastly of the item in whether mtbe is defective as a product just because it is mtbe it has clearly been ruled on several cases and common sense would dictate that something that is made properly and used properly and actually cleans up the air there is no way that can be a defective product
we were not even told it could until we walked in the floor and saw the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz
i am fine of that
the second point i want to make is i am not going to disparage what the gentleman from california mr waxman xz just said but when we were debating these amendments back of the early s we had numerous instances where he went in record saying that mbte was something that should be included as an oxygenate
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to speak out on order and engage of a colloquy with the chairman on the committee of agriculture
i give the gentleman my assurances i will work with him in language that reflects the commodity futures trading corporation s jurisdiction on its vital role of market transparency
the subject in the amendment executive order is already on effect and requires each federal agency to make achieving environmental justice part on its mission by identifying and addressing disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental affects on its programs policies and activities in minority populations and lowincome populations
mr chairman i will yield in my minutes to the gentleman if he wants to close of the amendment
mr chairman i commend the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz in his visual
so i would respectfully ask for a no vote in the castlemarkey amendment and then what we need to work in on the conference we will work of
i appreciate all his efforts and the faith he has placed of me in this issue which is so critical to new hampshire a state that has been affected significantly and obviously other affected states
as one who served of the committee in the budget and was here of i would suggest that this would be classified if one is an accountant as a contingent unfunded liability or a hypothetical unfunded liability
i have established it with the chairman a task force that is going to work between now and conference time in a plan that will structure a remediation program that will clean up the water not years from now or years from now not unfairly on this community and not on that community and not of this state or that state but across the whole country
madam speaker i thank the gentlewoman and commend her for organizing this hour that we can talk about this energy bill but we all hope we not only hope can pass in this floor but can actually of this congress become law because we have waited too long
when i got elected to congress on anwr was very much in my mind because one in the first issues we talked about was an energy bill
we have heard much about ethanol already tonight in the floor on the house
we ought to remember that there are precious few people who actually live on that very difficult very hostile environment on the world anwr which is literally in the coast in the arctic ocean
prudhoe bay which we often talk about is located here again literally of the edge in the arctic ocean
we actually flew over of a very small plane landed in a gravel runway and visited these people on kaktovik about in them actually manage to survive on that very very difficult environment
they fish for arctic char and they survive of them
this was after he told us how they depend of the caribou for their very survival
we should be focusing in reducing our dependence of foreign oil by diversifying our energy sources not by encouraging more oil and gas production
on the committee in rules my colleague the gentleman from nevada mr porter xz and i offered a simple amendment that would have included yucca mountain on the nuclear site threat assessment study already a part on the energy bill
unfortunately the committee in rules did not put that amendment of order
recently the department on energy revealed that federal employees working of the yucca mountain project deliberately falsified scientific documentation regarding water infiltration and climate studies
before creating an assistant secretary for nuclear issues and increasing our reliance in nuclear power we must find a safe and scientifically sound solution to the problem in disposing on tens on thousands in tons on radioactive toxic nuclear waste
this bill shortchanges water projects and energy technology research and development research into technologies to harness the sun and wind and reduce our dependence of foreign oil
i want to update my colleagues in the recent developments regarding yucca mountain and i sincerely hope that they listen
last month the department on energy revealed that scientists from the us geological survey who were working in the water infiltration and climate studies at yucca mountain actually falsified documentation
of the end i keep track in two sets in files the ones that will keep the qa happy and the ones that were actually used another email says like you said all along the yucca mountain project has now reached a point where they need to have certain items work no matter what and the infiltration maps are in that list
if they need proof i will be happy to make up more stuff no one better dare say to me in this floor that yucca mountain is based in sound science
doe is building yucca of a weak foundation based of lies fraud intimidation deception and nonexistent science
mr chairman i claim the time in the majority side for the committee in science
mr chairman it gives me great pleasure to yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz the illustrious chairman on the committee in science
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from south carolina mr inglis xz a member on the committee of science
of closing i express my appreciation for the leadership on the committee in science and my colleagues in the committee for their contributions to the development on the provisions of the r amp d title on hr
they are bipartisan forward thinking balanced and speak to the importance that we as a congress place of the role on technology on our energy future
i would also express my appreciation for the extremely professional staff in all the relevant committees as well as the key leadership staff who worked diligently of this bill for months and of some cases years
i want to thank the able staff in committee of science and its energy subcommittee
like the other assistant secretaries at doe the director position is in an executive schedule
like the other assistant secretaries at the doe the director position is a level iv of the executive schedule
i yield to the gentleman from new york the chairman on the committee in science
i want to be sure that your intent is for the secretary to focus his attention of existing doe sites and not go looking for private sites that might be used for interim storage
the bishopmarkeymcdermott amendment calls in the president to immediately suspend deliveries to the strategy petroleum reserve until oil prices fall below per barrel
mr chairman let us give americans of the northeast and in the west coast something to cheer about
one in the things that the chairman mentioned a few moments ago is bipartisan support that we have had in some in our initiatives and certainly we feel like we will see this in the energy bill
we saw it on committee and i would commend the gentleman from texas chairman barton for the wonderful work he did in the bill of committee
over the past few weeks we had democrats that voted with us of the continuity on government bill democrats voted with us of class action democrats voted with us in bankruptcy reform and supported us of repeal on the death tax and our real id
i want to congratulate the gentleman from texas mr barton xz and our colleagues in the committee of energy and commerce
i would like to remind my colleagues that over the last few weeks we have seen quite a bit in bipartisan support in some on our legislation
we had democrats vote with us of the continuity in government bill democrats voted with us in the class action bill democrats voted with the republicans of bankruptcy reform and supported our repeal on the death tax and the real id
so we look forward tomorrow to having our democrat colleagues from across the aisle join us as we move forward in our nation s energy policy
i also want to thank the gentleman for the wonderful leadership that he has shown of this bill
madam speaker i thank the gentleman so much for his thoughts and i thank him for his leadership of the committee in energy and commerce and the gentleman from texas is exactly right
it is an issue that affects our children and as he said it is an issue about the economy about security and how we need to look at our sources in oil our security and many times we feel we are too reliant in foreign oil which we are
madam speaker i thank the gentleman for his leadership of this issue and for his diligent work of behalf in his constituents and in behalf in all americans as we are working of this bill and bringing it forward to the house getting it ready to move forward and looking forward to the time that the president signs this into law so that we do have an energy policy
we have to think about the impact on this of the economy
i thank the gentleman from nebraska and at this point i yield to the gentleman from colorado mr beauprez xz who has been a leader of the energy issue has done a wonderful job for his constituents on the state on colorado and is going to talk with us for a few minutes about anwr and the implications in anwr
it is like putting a quarter of the dining room table that is the relationship on that space
so i thank the gentleman from colorado for his work of the issue
the gentleman from idaho who is a member and a leader in the committee in energy and commerce has certainly worked in some in the issues dealing with refineries and permitting
during the th congress that the gentleman from idaho mr otter xz spoke about that was the republicanled committee of energy and commerce held hearings related to a comprehensive energy bill
one in the things that we have all learned so well on our public service is if you want less in something pile in the taxes pile in the regulation because you are going to get less on it
i thank the gentleman from idaho mr otter xz for his good work of this effort
a gentleman who has been a leader of the issue on small business and taxation and regulation and how that affects our economy is the gentleman from iowa mr king xz
i appreciate the leadership that the gentleman shows on the committee in the budget and on the republican study committee as we work to lower taxes and spending and address appropriate regulation
this bill does that and does put the focus in biodiesel biomass ethanol wind hydropower hybrid cars hydrogen fuel cells solar power and all on those alternative and renewable energy sources so that we will have a goal in reducing that dependence of foreign oil
i yield to the gentlewoman from north carolina ms foxx xz for her comments in the bill
as we continue with our debate as we were saying earlier we will be looking at electricity and we are going to have some provisions on this bill that the federal government is going to lead of energy conservation issues
this bill is virtually identical to dick cheney s energy task force and where the house has been these last years with concerns notwithstanding the enron scandal skyrocketing gasoline prices and demands of scarce oil supplies of unstable parts in the world
it is true that lots in people have been working very hard in this bill but i would suggest that never have so many worked so hard and so long to do so little to change the direction in this country s energy future
for the sake on the country one hopes that there will come a time when the needs and wishes on the public is heard and it will be reflected of an energy policy for this century costeffective and rational preserving the quality in life rather than operating in the cheap
there is much discussion of the floor about things that are mandatory
the conserve by bike amendment recognizes that it is time to better understand the positive effects that bicycling can have in the conservation on our energy resources
mr chairman i appreciate the gentleman s courtesy on yielding me this time and permitting me to speak of this and for his bringing this forward
intelligent transportation has tremendous potential for energy savings to put money back on the pockets in taxpayers and consumers around the country and it is an example that we do not have to make this equation quite as hard as we tend to of the floor on the house
i appreciate the gentleman s leadership of focusing in the notion on the billion that is spent dealing with energy on this country
i appreciate my colleague s leadership on focusing of what impact research and technology can have on this critical area
by focusing in intelligent transportation it will be one important area in research application that will make a difference for millions on americans it will save hundreds on millions in gallons in fuel and it will improve the quality in life for our communities on the offing
the second point is that we have not voted in this
the ever growing concerns about energy reliability the enron scandal skyrocketing gas prices increasing demands in ever scarce supplies on unstable areas in the world all have not produced a change of the mindset on congress
wind and solar energy are abundant and nonpolluting with a fraction in the resources lavished of traditional energy sources alternative energy could increase the production and reduce cost
on oregon pacificorp is of the process on relicensing a number on dams in the klamath river
i am disappointed that congress defeated a number on democratic amendments that would have boosted fuel efficiency removed language allowing drilling the arctic national wildlife refuge kept of place important consumer protections and reduced our dependence of foreign oil
and for the leadership on this chairman the leadership in the chairman on the committee in ways and means and the leadership on the chairman on the committee of resources i am grateful
i am also grateful to our friends in the other side led by the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz
while they may not have agreed with all in the final product certainly many parts on this product benefited from the work they did of this committee
we are now going of sixteen years with no energy plan for america and it is not for lack on trying
keeping the lights of should not be a partisan issue
louis ever runs short in their boutique fuel gas stations there ca nt sell what consumers could buy back of springfield
the energy bill we will vote in tomorrow caps the number in these special fuel blends and allows communities faced with a shortage due to unforeseen circumstances such as a refinery fire a waiver to use conventional gasoline
this plan relies of simple economics if we create a larger market for a greater amount on gasoline we ll help drive prices down
this bill will not lessen our dependence of foreign oil and it will do nothing to reduce energy prices
our growing dependence of foreign oil puts us at the mercy in unstable and unfriendly foreign regimes
we would start every day millionplus of the hole in our balance on trade because in the imported oil
so what do we do to reduce our dependence of foreign oil
the federal energy information administration found that last year s energy bill would have almost no impact in energy demand and energy prices and that bill if anything made more in an effort to tame consumption
at a time in fiscal crises and record oil prices the bill provides new mandatory spending that will go directly to the oil industry and it provides mandatory breaks for the oil industry of royalties
here is what the president said last week of that issue with oil we do nt need incentives to oil and gas companies to explore the president s budget devoted percent in its proposed energy tax incentives to alternatives
while the house has been writing a bill based of ideological purity rather than careful analysis others have come forward with bipartisan sensible balanced approaches to energy policy
groups like the national commission in energy policy and the alliance to save energy and the energy future coalition have all offered carefully considered proposals that could have formed the basis in an effective bill with republican credentials
first we can not become less dependent in foreign oil unless we increase the fuel economy in our vehicles
we are in a collision course with disaster
second we have been losing ground in fuel economy
so i hope that when the senate comes back with this same provision as i expect they will we will be able to work it out based in the facts
i am especially pleased at its focus in renewable energy and i thank chairman barton for including my renewable energy production incentive repi legislation on the bill
teaming together with private enterprise we can become less dependent of using fossil fuels for our homes and our cars
to address that need and its impact of our economy this legislation also helps expand domestic exploration
it is critical for our nation to have a national strategy in energy so we can clear many on these hurdles looming of our future
again i wish to thank chairman barton for his diligence and effort in this legislation
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from michigan for yielding this time to me and commend him of his outstanding leadership with regard to the energy bill now before us
in particular interest to me is the title in coal which would provide for the implementation on the clean coal power initiative to develop projects that would utilize clean coal technologies
coal is our nation s most abundant natural resource for energy production and it is appropriate that we take steps to accomplish the goal on incenting coal use and thereby relieving to some extent the pressure that we are experiencing at the present time of natural gas prices
i am concerned however that the bill before us includes a provision that would cap spending of the implementation on the reliability standards
i want to conclude these remarks by complimenting again the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz of his outstanding leadership and also complimenting the gentleman from texas mr barton xz in the committee in energy and commerce
he was willing to work on a bipartisan fashion on order to establish consensus of a number in these measures
it would create reporting requirements based in the recordkeeping requirements under the federal securities laws for all wholesale energy transactions
it would increase civil and criminal penalties under the federal power act modeled of the penalties established on the sarbanesoxley law
it would direct the ferc to review approved marketbased rates of an annual basis to remain sure that they are fair and reasonable as circumstances change
the people on anwr are counting in this congress to do the right thing and allow them the rightful owners on these mineral rights to begin developing the sources that were granted to them upon statehood on
the increasing use in hybrid vehicles shows that a marketbased approach to increasing fuel efficiency is a better way to reduce american oil consumption than by placing arbitrary standards in automobiles that harm our domestic manufacturers
we are at a point of our nation s history where we can not afford to turn our back in any reasonable power source to meet our nation s energy needs
during our committee hearing in february we had a lively and substantial debate in the mtbe limited defective product liability waiver contained of the energy bill
and during our markup last week the committee considered a number in amendments of the mtbe provisions including several offered by mrs capps
during our hearing in the th we heard testimony from many different people including mr erik olson of behalf in the national resources defense council
the gentleman has done a magnificent job leading the committee of this new bill
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman for engaging on this colloquy with me addressing the department in defense dod s concern on any decision ferc would make authorizing the siting on liquefied natural gas facilities lng of or contiguous to our defense installations
should a proposal to site an lng terminal be of or adjacent to a military installation or range i believe there would be concerns that should be addressed as to whether there may be an impact upon military operations training and readiness
i have spoken with the officials at the department on defense and assessing nonmilitary impacts to installation operations and training is something they are capable in and on fact do of a regular basis
it is my belief the department in defense should have a role of assessing the impact on such proposed sitings to be considered of or contiguous to a military installation or range
this legislation is the result in hundreds in hours in work developing a plan that will reduce our dependence in foreign oil improve our economy and create jobs
it provides for safer stable and more reliable energy sources within our own country making us less reliant in oil from the middle east
they pass of huge costly problems to other parties
of this case hr would shift the costs on cleaning up mtbe groundwater contamination of to the towns the cities and the water districts around this country
even the chairman on the committee in energy and commerce has acknowledged that
it still went of adding it to gasoline
recent court cases regarding responsibility for mtbe groundwater contamination have come down of the side in local water companies and cities
after it sued cambria was able to get chevron to pay a million settlement to help the town to build a desalinization plant but under this bill the taxpayers on cambria and on hundreds on towns large and small across this country would be forced to pay for the mtbe cleanup in their own
we should support the point on order and take this terrible provision out which is going to force our constituents to shoulder the burden on cleanup of to the constituents
the republican leadership knows it could well lose a vote of such amendment
i wanted to offer an amendment to strike this provision because of its wisdom the house leadership would not want to vote of this
perhaps it is because too many members of both sides on the aisle represent districts with bad mtbe problems of places where lawsuits are pending
this is cbo s analysis in the bill and i quote section would shield manufacturers in motor fuels and other persons from liability for claims based in defective product
mr chairman i yield minute to the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz the ranking member on the committee in energy and commerce
first i appreciate the leader s acknowledgment in process because the process is very important
i think the debate that we are having in the floor should have been had prior to the rule being brought under a very partisan environment for passage in the first day in session
i served in the ethics committee for over years during some very difficult times including the bank issues including a charge against the speaker in the house
on my entire time of the ethics committee we never had a partisan division
it is interesting to point out that the investigation and the charges that were held against speaker gingrich brought about a lot in controversy in this floor
there were some votes that took place of the floor in the house that were recommended against by the task force that changed some in the recommendations and we had a motion to recommit to try to clarify that
the gentleman is correct of the final vote but the package itself was very much developed of a bipartisan manner through the task force of a way that it should have been done contrary to the process that was used of this rules package
mr chairman let me make four quick points of this amendment
but the bottom line is that the process that is of this legislation which supplants the existing process of my judgment tramples of the rights on the states and the individual communities as they have indicated of their letters to us to be able to influence these decisions that are made
if you read this carefully you will see that hr requires ferc to consult with the state but it clearly removes the directive that ferc base its decision of community support or opposition which it does now
of the other hand for the states and the local areas to give up their jurisdiction and their ability to influence this decision i think would be absolutely wrong
for instance it says of page the term federal authorization means any authorization required under federal law on order to construct expand or operate a liquefaction or gasification natural gas terminal including such permits special use authorizations certifications opinions or other approvals as may be required whether issued by a federal or state agency you are basically taking what has been partially codified and developed by procedure and you are trying to codify it here of what is a much tighter measure giving to the energy commission the ability to make the decision and overrule what happens at the state and local levels
twentythree on the state s generating facilities run of coal and employ over employees
the technology exists today to make all vehicles to go farther in a gallon on gas while improving safety and consumer choice
this amendment would save american consumers money at the gas pump protects the environment and cuts america s dangerous dependence of oil
finally i supported a motion to strike a provision of hr that has been identified by the congressional budget office as an unfunded mandate in state and local governments and the private sector
this provision shifts the cleanup in methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe burden of communities and the federal government
fact this bill makes our country more dependent of fossil fuels from places like the mideast as scientists in all ideologies have stated that the limited amount in oil will not result on a lessening in oil dependency for the us fiction opening anwr will weaken opec and strengthen the us fact the bush administration s own department in energy contradicts this point when it determined last year that if world oil markets continue as they currently do opec could countermand any potential price impact on arctic refuge production by reducing its exports by an equal amount
fact drilling on anwr will not lower gas prices at the pump will not protect our national sovereignty and will not reduce our dependence in foreign oil
specifically the solis amendment would strip out language that cynically allows refineries to move into economically distressed communities override federal environmental laws trample of local zoning laws and ignore community opposition to set up shop
while i represent new york city and do not see any oil refineries planning to set up shop there any time soon this amendment is an attack of all communities facing tough times and will lead to greater victimization in people suffering
that is a lot on miles of the highway to do business and a lot on money at the gas pump
this spike on gas prices has real consequences for people on wyoming whose drives to work are measured not by the length on the country and western song of the radio but by the entire country and western album
when our country was threatened by terror attacks in congress acted
this bill will cut our reliance in foreign energy and put our focus where it belongs in domestic production
it will strengthen america s standing as the nation with the most strict environmental laws in earth
it will streamline the process to safely explore for new energy sources and put us of the road to energy selfsufficiency
america s energy policy at this critical time should pioneer the use on renewable fuels and move our nation away from dependence in fossil fuels
at a minimum national energy legislation should reduce our dependence in foreign oil however the us energy information administration has concluded that the legislation before us today will not support the development and wide usage in renewable fuels or even reduce our reliance in foreign oil
similarly hr would provide billion to support research of recovering oil and gas resources from the deep waters of the gulf on mexico despite the fact that oil companies are generating record profits
while the groups who met with vice president cheney were clearly focused of maintaining the status quo of america s energy policy there are on fact many things that can be done to decrease our dependence of fossil fuels and particularly to decrease our dependence in foreign oil
further we can increase spending in the development on bioenergy and other renewable fuels
however the president s shortsighted fiscal budget proposes to limit expenditures in these initiatives to just million
such reductions on spending in bioenergy especially given the provisions on the hr are misguided
i urge a no vote in this legislation
i have not had a chance to speak in the floor but i thought this fit right of line with environmental justice
the gentleman from california mr pombo xz did that of and my colleagues in the other side fought that tooth hook and nail
the bill could be made much better including by an amendment that i have offered that the committee of rules refused to be made of order
what this bill does is undermine that process that has worked very well for decades and the rule deprives the house in representatives in an open and honest debate about the fact that this bill is tantamount to repeal on the coastal zone management act and i do not think any member in congress wants to stand of this floor and admit or agree that we should repeal the coastal zone management act
we are once again remarkably trampling in the rights in our states
the beaches of the coast in state on the florida should be judged and policed by the governor in the state in florida not by somebody on an agency of washington
mr chairman i support this bill so that we can and the public can rely in the energyconscious information that they are getting and that they know that is correct and accurate and they can move forward with that
our constituents must be able to rely of these facts to be the energyconscious consumers they want to be
second our country will always have to rely in foreignproduced oil
the president s own energy administration have said this bill will have only negligible impact of production consumption and imports on oil
what this bill does is to authorize more money for existing energy producers to increase oil drilling on sensitive areas for sources in supply that will not greatly reduce future reliance of foreign oil
a major report by the national commission in energy policy advocated enhancing oil security by reforming and significantly strengthening vehicle efficiency standards
drilling there would not address the nearterm supply in oil and therefore gas prices and is not projected to have a major impact in reducing dependence in foreign oil
there are a host on other issues that affect my constituents of the coast in california
these relate to the ability to appeal decisions under the coastal zone management act and incentives for drilling for oil of the outer continental shelf
of addition the bill increases the power in the federal energy regulatory commission the body which has failed to order appropriate refunds for california utility consumers based of the manipulation in the power market
while i applaud a number in measures like continuing the energy star program for appliances and providing grants in million of to develop or promote photo voltaic technologies these measures are modest compared to the overall need for investing of alternative energy sources and passing measures to decrease our dependence of petroleum
a recently released gao report requested by the committee in government reform confirms that doe contract management should remain of the gao highrisk list
our committee in government reform which has jurisdiction over the federal civil service and therefore the creation on new layers on bureaucracy unanimously agreed to strike this section from the energy bill when the committee marked up our provisions last week
based in conversations with my colleague that support the creation in these new positions this is an issue that i pledge to work with them of as the bill moves through the conference
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent for additional minute of each side
madam chairman over the past couple in years i have corresponded with the department on energy in an issue in particular concern to me
regarding question numbered in the letter we have been informed that while the district judge accepted the defendants standard on proof for injuries that decision was soundly reversed by the ninth circuit in the merits
i recently learned that federal judge nielsen in march rejected the motion on dupont and general electric that they be dismissed from the case because they contracted with the government to run hanford
rather we should be reducing our dependence in foreign oil by improving our energy efficiency and maximizing our domestic energy production of an environmentallysound way by investing on cleaner more secure energy sources such as solar wind biomass and fuel cell technology
my state on connecticut is a leader on fuel cell technology with several businesses doing research that is of the cusp in revolutionizing the way our nation powers its homes cars and businesses
mr speaker the house will convene of tuesday at pm
any votes called in these measures will be rolled until pm
of wednesday and thursday the house will convene at am
the gentleman has touched of many points
i am advised and i stand to be corrected but having served in the committee of appropriations the rules allow that once we pass the april deadline for having a budget the committee of appropriations is allowed to start their work without a budget
i am advised also by the gentleman from california chairman lewis on the committee in appropriations who is walking on front on me right now and hopefully will correct me if i am wrong that the gentleman from california chairman lewis has begun the appropriations process on earnest and he has a very ambitious schedule
of fact i am told that we will have the opportunity to schedule appropriations bills for the floor by the middle in may and i anticipate not anticipate we have set as a schedule another way on putting it we have turned over the schedule to the committee of appropriations to get their work done
so i would assume that we could have a conference report in a budget hopefully by the first on may
obviously i can not anticipate what the committee of rules may do in this bill
i do recall that of the last congress when we approached the energy bill there was i think at least if not more amendments allowed of the bill
the speaker in the house looked at the last few years and decided that the rules allowed the use in the committee of standards in official conduct for partisan purposes and its ability to act of a bipartisan way was seriously hindered
the committee in its own decided to change the way they operated from the past
this committee and the last committee had decided in their own that without consulting with the affected member to send a public letter and release the underlying documents to support their position without the opportunity for a member to face the committee and discuss those letters in warning the speaker felt very strongly that that undermines the rights on every member both democrat and republican to due process
that suggestion by the speaker as the gentleman knows was brought to this house and debated extensively in this house floor and those amendments to the rules were passed by the entire house with some nay votes i understand
i am advised through the speaker that the chairman on the committee of standards on official conduct is working with his ranking member and i would hope that they would come to some sort on agreement on how we get past this impasse
in the process side the gentleman is correct
and i do not want to secondguess the speaker and the gentleman may well have a good argument of process
now what happens on practice is if that member that has been charged receives from the committee that they are moving towards an investigative subcommittee that is a huge hit of that member whether he is guilty or not
mr speaker i appreciate the comments by the gentleman who worked so hard of that bipartisan ethics reform taskforce that made recommendations to the house
and i appreciate that the gentleman is trying to protect those rules that he worked of
but i remind the gentleman that when those rules were voted of both gentlemen from maryland voted against the rules they are trying to protect today
i do not know what the result on that has been but i know that the speaker has been informed by the chairman that he is more than willing to work in those issues and i know the speaker told me that he is open to fixing that time problem that the gentleman brings up and is concerned about
this was voted in september and it was of the recommendations for reforming the committee in standards on official conduct and the gentleman that worked of the recommendation and the gentleman speaking voted against the recommendations not in the house rules package
a commission would just open up the whole recommendations that the gentleman from maryland worked of and the gentleman from louisiana worked in
and i have got to tell you the members of your side in the aisle as well as my side on the aisle better think about this very seriously because we do want to protect the integrity in the institution
the bill also forecloses a vote in the billions on dollars bestowed on this bill to producers in mtbe
are we being allowed to debate and vote of this amendment which would inconvenience powerful oil and gas producers
i urge my colleagues to see to it that we teach the rules committee that their function is to facilitate debate not to deny members the opportunity to discuss matters on importance of this floor
it jeopardizes not only fish but the overall health on our river systems and the recreational activities that they sustain and it confers unfairly rights of people while not taking the same care in the concern on the citizenry generally
madam chairman it is regrettable indeed that we function under such a constrained rule but the amendment which i have been permitted to offer here contains real benefits for electricity consumers and includes many on the reforms that i and other in my colleagues have proposed on committee markups in the house floor and of conference during consideration on various energy bills
the liability waiver amounts to a massive unfunded mandate of local governments and citizens
mr chairman the language in this bill which appropriates million from the nuclear waste fund to carry out the purposes on the nuclear waste policy act on does not in its face present policy concerns
as the us supreme court ruled on its opinion lincoln v vigil it is a fundamental principle in appropriations law that where congress merely appropriates lumpsum amounts without statutory restriction a clear inference may be drawn that it does not intend to impose legally funding restrictions and indicia on committee reports and other legislative history as to how the funds should or are expected to be spent do not establish any legal requirements of the agency nonetheless report language that conflicts with an agency s statutory responsibilities warrants a response
interim storage is likely to divert doe s funds and attention just when the department needs to focus in submitting a license to the nrc and in getting yucca mountain up and running
when the same collection on fossil fuel dinosaurs and tax loophole lobbyists come here and order congress to fill er up with special favors they seldom go away of empty national security demands a balanced energy policy that encourages more new energy technology and renewable alternatives
our families health depends in clean air and water but this collection on tax breaks loopholes handouts and waivers ensures only continued healthy profits for some in the worst polluters of the world
take for example the synthetic fuel provision that i tried unsuccessfully to strike on the committee of ways and means it is really about tax dodging through synthetic accounting
unscrupulous companies get what some estimate to be up to billion a year by spraying starch of coal or pine tar in coal
that is why enron was about to embark of this gimmick that so many companies have abused and which this committee in ways and means refuses to end
this energy bill is not just about overreliance of fossil fuels
with our security at stake when so much in the world s oil is located of areas as inflammable above ground as the fuel they hold underground with our families health dependent of not letting the quality on our air and our water deteriorate even further than it has under this administration this energy bill is the latest example in spending today while the future will be billed of dollars safety and health
mr chairman today we are about to further our independence in foreign sources in energy
the solution is not more litigation and lawsuits but recognition that the federal government pushed mtbe in our communities and now our communities need our help
i would particularly like to commend the chairman and the staff on working with both sides here of this bill
additional funds are provided for priority work in advanced scientific computing high energy physics and operation in user facilities
we must keep america s scientific knowledge strong and of the cutting edge
of my home state in pennsylvania which is not normally thought in as a state closely tied to the automotive industry a total on jobs are dependent in the industry in these people are directly employed by it and when you add on other spinoff employment we are talking about over jobs on pennsylvania alone
mr speaker the committee in rules may meet next week to grant a rule which could limit the amendment process for floor consideration in the energy policy act on which is expected to be introduced monday april as hr
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit copies on the amendment one written copy in a brief explanation on the amendment and one electronic copy on the same to the committee of rules up on h in the capitol by noon in tuesday april
members are advised that the combined text from the committees in jurisdiction should be available for their review of the committees web sites as well as in the committee in rules web site by tomorrow friday april
i wish we could have made a lot more amendments of order but we made amendments on order of this measure
i believe that we are going to allow for the debate to take place of a wide range on issues
i want to congratulate all in my colleagues and committee chairmen who have worked in this
we have been this close this close to making it happen of the past mr speaker and unfortunately the fact that we have not been able to make it happen on the past has played a role of increasing the cost on gasoline has played a role of ensuring that we have not been able to pursue alternative sources in energy has played a role of making us more dependent in foreign sources on oil
so mr speaker i will say that i believe that we now are in the verge on what will be another great bipartisan victory of this congress
i am very proud that democrats and republicans have come together of large numbers in both sides to pass bankruptcy reform legislation class action reform legislation our continuity on congress bill permanent repeal in the death tax and passage in the real id
this amendment contains a number on provisions designed to reduce dependence of nonrenewable energy sources
i can not support hr as it is written today despite my great affection for our chairman who was more than fair when we had the markup of the committee in energy and commerce but this bishopmarkey amendment would provide critical improvements to it
i do not believe there is a commitment of the majority side to look at renewable fuels
i am very disappointed and i urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to support this amendment
the intense polarization on the energy debate has been compounded by the leadership s insistence of repeatedly forcing congress to consider essentially the same bill
congress had a great opportunity to produce a balanced energy policy that is diversified reduces our dependence of oil and invests on alternative energy but our leadership chose to essentially recycle an old bill that favors special interests over consumers
american energy policy is at the crossroads and our national security is being compromised daily by our dependence of foreign energy supplies
although i appreciate chairman barton s willingness to extend hearings in energy this year prior to the th congress s consideration on the energy policy act i was very disappointed that a letter that in my colleagues and i sent to chairman barton at the beginning in february requesting that our committee invite the national commission in energy policy to testify went unanswered
new york which banned mtbe of january will long be dealing with the repercussions in mtbe contamination
on and around jamaica queens where more than a million nyc residents and businesses rely of groundwater instead in surface water from the upstate reservoirs mtbe has contaminated much on the groundwater supply of the aquifer
the first which i introduced during the house energy and commerce committee consideration in hr expresses the sense on congress that energy cooperation between the united states in america and israel is mutually beneficial acknowledges the cooperative agreement between the us and israel and states the department in energy should report in past and future cooperative energy projects between the us and israel
as the cochair in the congressional oil and national security caucus i know we need to ensure that our energy policy is diversified reduce our dependence of oil and create skilled jobs while reducing energy costs
its passage will set us of the right path by encouraging the creation in new technologies by promoting renewable energy sources by modernizing and expanding our energy infrastructure including our power energy infrastructure and encouraging conservation
i believe we need to move forward in this bill
the bill paves the way for building energy facilities in the outer continental shelf including areas subject to gas and oil drilling
of listening to state leaders about this bill i could not find anyone from the governor in down who has said that this is a wonderful bill and it should be supported and passed
under this rule i do not think we even have the opportunity to debate and vote of the most important amendments dealing with them
dear governor schwarzenegger in april th our committees the house committee in energy and commerce and the house committee in resources completed work of elements in a comprehensive energy bill that will come before the full house on representatives as soon as april th
as we and other members on the delegation determine how to best represent the interests on our state we believe it s important to understand your views in some in the key provisions before us as well as your overall position of the legislation
they were part on the conference report in hr which was considered by the house and senate of
under this bill states will not be allowed to present new evidence to the secretary and the secretary will not be allowed to seek out evidence in his or her own
the secretary will only be allowed to rely in the record compiled by ferc
energy related facilities of the outer continental shelf ocs provisions from hr the bill will give the department in interior permitting authority for alternative energy projects such as wind projects situated in the outer continental shelf ocs
it also grants the department in interior authority to permit other types in energy facilities including facilities to support the exploration development production transportation or storage on oil natural gas or other minerals these facilities could be permitted within coastal areas currently subject to congressional moratoria in oil and gas leasing
of a time on skyrocketing gas prices this new mandate amounts to hidden tax in california motorists which will subsidize a single industry located largely on the midwest
under current law federal resource agencies can impose conditions of a hydroelectric license for the protection on natural resources and wildlife
under the bill a dam operator and only a dam operator will be entitled to a trialtype hearing before a resource agency to dispute the evidence that the agency uses to justify placing conditions in a license
we believe there are many other aspects on the legislation which will have a negative impact in our state but these provisions clearly run contrary to the interests in california and we believe they will undermine the policies and positions the state is pursuing under your administration
before the delegation votes in this legislation members should have the benefit in your views of these provisions and the bill as a whole
this legislation is too important a matter for the nation s largest state to be silent of
therefore we ask for your input before the house votes of this legislation this week
sincerely lt center gt anna g eshoo lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee of energy and commerce lt em gt lt center gt henry a waxman lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee of energy and commerce lt em gt lt center gt lois capps lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee in energy and commerce lt em gt lt center gt grace f napolitano lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee in resources lt em gt lt center gt george miller lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee in resources lt em gt lt center gt hilda l solis lt center gt lt center gt lt em gt committee of energy and commerce lt em gt protection council sacramento ca april
dear representatives waxman eshoo capps and solis thank you for your march letter to the california ocean protection council regarding the pending national energy bill and your concerns about potential impact on this legislation of ocean and coastal protection
the california ocean protection act is intended to help california coordinate and act in ocean and coastal issues on statewide and national significance
at our first meeting of march the council discussed the need to maintain strong ocean and coastal protection measures
as a council we did not suggest a position of the energy bill but reached consensus of the need to reaffirm california s position of the following ocean and coastal protection issues congressional oil and gas moratorium
the council opposes any effort to lift the congressional moratorium in offshore oil and gas leasing activities that has been protecting our shores since
we appreciate the opportunity to provide input of these critical issues facing california and other coastal states
finally any proposal that would give way to the lifting in the moratorium of offshore oil drilling along our coast is abhorrent to the vast majority in california s voters and its public officials
in march the other members on the ocean council joined me of expressing opposition to this socalled energy bill as the council s first official act
dear representatives barton and dingell of behalf in the california coastal commission the commission i write to express our strong objection to provisions on the energy bill that would compromise the outer continental shelf ocs moratorium in oil drilling seriously weaken the coastal zone management act czma protection on states rights and eviscerate california s role on siting new liquefied natural gas lng terminals
such an inventory would seriously undermining the longstanding bipartisan legislative moratorium of new mineral leasing activity in submerged lands in the ocs that has been included the commission also objects to proposed amendments to the czma
dear representative eshoo the california public utilities commission cpuc strongly opposes the liquefied natural gas lng provisions on section in title iii on the energy policy act in epact and urges you to vote on favor in any proposed amendment to strike section from title iii during markup which we understand will take place in tuesday april
it is not a question for us should there be lng terminals in the west coast including california
it was the ferc who rejected the cpuc s request for a hearing of that proceeding even though the proposed lng facilities at the port in long beach would be on a densely populated area and built in landfill with active for these reasons we urge you to oppose section and vote on favor in striking the lng provisions from the proposed epact
so when a member rises in the floor and talks about retroactive and it is not fair to have something retroactive we have to have the arm on the law reach back so consumers are refunded the dollars that they were ripped off
four of march a coalition on california governmental entities and public utilities presented the ferc with more than pages on evidence documenting a pervasive pattern on market manipulation that resulted of disastrous effects of prices and reliability and of march the ferc confirmed that significant power manipulation had taken place on the west
mr chairman on a cautionary letter to the president last month a group on defense experts including conservatives robert mcfarlane frank gaffney and boyden gray said the following with only percent in the world s oil reserves but percent on current world consumption the united states can not eliminate its need for imports through increased domestic production alone our dependence of foreign oil is putting our country on a perilous situation
no constituent is going to stand up and say put the tax burden of us and allow the industry to get away with it
let us not stand in the wrong leg and try and defend something that is indefensible
so i ask my colleagues of a bipartisan basis let us do the right thing
instead the burden in mtbe clean up will fall entirely of states and localities
it s an unfunded mandate and a tax of the american people
of response to the public health threat states have established action levels cleanup levels or drinking water standards for mtbe states have imposed full or partial bans in mtbe on gasoline
with oil prices hitting record levels and repeated predictions that the cost on a barrel on oil could hit over on the coming years we should be focusing our efforts of alleviating our nation s dependence of fossil fuels
hr should have been an honest bipartisan effort to halt america s growing dependence in fossil fuels for energy
it could have been focused of developing new technologies improving energy efficiency promoting renewable energy and conducting the research and development that could produce the breakthroughs that would power the world on tomorrow
instead on creating a truly comprehensive plan for addressing our energy needs this legislation sets us in the wrong path making us more reliant of oil than we already are
it will not help consumers save of energy costs and it will not help the us become energy independent
this legislation sends us of the wrong direction by relying in the fuels in today to provide energy on the future
of order to create a policy that looks to future needs and us security we can not rely of increased drilling and oil refineries
finding new efficient clean renewable sources in energy is not just better than continuing down the path hr sends us of it is necessary for the security in the us
we are missing an opportunity here as a future energy policy this legislation is bumbling along because on following the policies on this bill would be like driving into the future by looking through the rearview mirror with its heavily weighted dependence in fossil fuels
based in the proindustry recommendations in the cheney energy task force report this bill is antitaxpayer antienvironment anticonsumer and is loaded down with specialinterest giveaways
by contrast only about six percent in the tax breaks would go to energy efficiency and renewable energy incentives that could actually save consumers money and reduce our dependence of dirty energy sources
according to the bush administration s own energy department estimates this republican bill will actually increase gas prices by cents and will have virtually no effect of production consumption or barrel prices
these include changes on lng terminal siting weakening the coastal zone management act and expanding alternative energy projects situated in the outer continental shelf ocs
under hr states will not be allowed to present new evidence to the secretary and the secretary will not be allowed to seek out evidence of his or her own
the secretary will only be allowed to rely in the record compiled by ferc
hr will give the department on interior permitting authority for alternative energy projects such as wind projects situated in the outer continental shelf ocs
i urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation so we can develop a comprehensive energy policy that looks to the future and does nt rely in repackaged outdated technologies from the past
we appreciate the chairman and the committee s hard work in this bill
of the s rose bay was a productive estuary and shellfish harvesting area in the halifax river of volusia county
i would ask the chairman s help along with the committee s to do everything we can to get this project back of the appropriate steps forward
in a more personal note i also want to thank the chairman for supporting the green brook flood control project which is on my district of new jersey
for more than years the gentleman from new jersey mr frelinghuysen xz as a member in the committee in appropriations has been a champion for the green brook flood control project
the gentleman from ohio chairman hobson and every member in the committee of appropriations has a considerable task and responsibility in prioritizing local projects
we could have boosted our nation s commitment to renewable and efficient energy thereby curbing our reliance in foreign oil creating st century jobs protecting the environment and providing affordable and reliable energy for america s families
we could have taken in the oil companies that are gouging all our constituents at the gas pumps
yet the republicans of the rules committee shot down this common sense amendment preventing us from even taking a vote in it
with the highest child asthma rate on california imperial county certainly needs the help but the republicans in the rules committee once again turned their backs in us
namely the amendment would create a billion program over the next years to provide incentives for car manufacturers to dramatically increase their production on hybrid and advanced diesel vehicles and for consumers as well mr chairman to purchase those vehicles at a discount and get them in the road as quickly as possible
hr makes every effort to address our dependence of foreign oil
this small amount that would go towards the development in hybrid vehicles would allow us to do two or three things right away mr chairman first to increase our fuel standards without addressing some in the more controversial ways that came up of the floor yesterday involving cafe standards and increases there
a hybrid honda insight is rated at miles per gallon of the city and miles per gallon in the highway
a comparable traditional honda civic gets just miles per gallon of the city and miles per gallon of the highway
it is one that has no partisan stripes only an effort to help clean up the environment find ways to reduce our dependence of foreign oil and create good old american jobs here of this country
so i guess i should congratulate you of the bipartisanship on your contempt for democracy
our bill includes essential funding for energy programs that seek to make our country more efficient and less dependent of traditional fossil fuels and foreign oil
this bill also prioritizes the army corps work of a number on essential navigation and flood control projects to ensure that such construction projects authorized by congress are actually completed
the economic return in keeping open our nation s third largest port to larger container ships is huge
for too many years madam chairman our domestic energy policy has languished driving investment overseas and increasing our reliance in foreign energy resources
yet we continue the cycle on tolerating irresponsible energy policies continuing to discourage investment on domestic energy production and subsequently becoming more dependent of foreign sources in energy
relying in foreign and sometimes hostile nations for energy and minerals jeopardizes our national security madam chairman
hr also contains provisions to spur production on renewable energies such as geothermal so we can reduce our reliance in traditional sources
through this important legislation we will have increased ability to utilize the vast renewable energy resources in our public lands on an environmentally responsible manner
i urge all in my colleagues to support the passage in this legislation that will allow us to capitalize in our nation s energy exploration and development technology commitment to environmental quality and conservation and work ethic to develop our domestic energy resources
this is the area we are going to be drilling of for oil and gas
i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his great work of this bill
mr chairman this country needs to create a new energy landscape that begins shrinking our disproportionate reliance of foreign energy sources and begins building one that places american ingenuity producers and consumers at the forefront
mr chairman i rise to congratulate my good friend the gentleman from texas mr barton xz the chairman on the committee in energy and commerce for his leadership on forging a comprehensive cohesive energy policy for our nation
mr chairman i seek the assurance on the gentleman from texas mr barton xz that he will work with me and concerned others in language that clarifies the commodity futures trading commission s exclusive jurisdiction with respect to accounts agreements and transactions involving commodity futures and options
first i would like to thank the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz chairman in the committee of science and the gentlewoman from illinois mrs biggert xz chair in the subcommittee in energy for their hard work and cooperation on developing the foundation in title ix the r amp d title on this bill
while the bill of the floor today has provisions that are not acceptable to many democrats and republicans there are good points worth mentioning on title ix
i would also like to highlight the work on several in our members of key components on doe research and development on title ix the interest in the gentleman from california mr honda xz on the progress in the next generation lighting initiative the stanford linear accelerator and the joint genomics institute and his work with the gentleman from connecticut mr larson xz of transit bus demonstrations on fuel cells the continued dedication in the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz and the gentleman from colorado mr udall xz to clean renewable and efficient energy technologies the work on the gentleman from illinois mr costello xz to ensure that utilization on our vast coal resources only gets cleaner and more efficient the vision on the gentlewoman from california ms zoe lofgren xz of support on domestic fusion energy research and international fusion projects the work on the gentleman from tennessee mr davis xz to ensure good science continues at oak ridge national laboratory particularly on the area on highend computing the efforts on the gentleman from north carolina mr miller xz to establish a nationwide network on advanced energy technology transfer centers to get technologies off the laboratory shelf and into the marketplace finally the tireless commitment on the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz to research and development at historically black colleges and universities and other minorityserving institutions
the committee of science contributed virtually all on title ix the research and development title on this bill
i am proud to say that i have long been a proponent on banning oil and gas drilling of the great lakes and have voted to do so at every possible opportunity
congress has a history of support on banning drilling in the great lakes
however the time has come to end the uncertainty surrounding drilling in the great lakes
while i am disappointed the rules committee has prevented the house from including a ban of drilling in the great lakes i plan to work night and day with my colleagues to get a permanent ban approved either on conference or as a standalone piece on legislation
of particular i plan to push for the inclusion on a ban in oil and gas drilling on the great lakes
very quickly i want to thank the chairman for inclusion in a number on provisions of the bill such as the provision encouraging the siting of liquefied natural gas lng which is important to energy security to cut into the rising natural gas prices that threaten our economy
the bill contains a study of liheap reform
madam chairman i thank the chairman in the committee of resources for yielding me this time
the doom and gloom scenarios by opponents in anwr oil are inaccurate and not based of reality
mr chairman i reluctantly rise on opposition because the gentlewoman from california ms solis xz is a good member in our committee and we work in lots in issues together
mr chairman i guess this is a postponed vote of mtbe
it is an issue we have been dealing with at least on the committee of energy and commerce for a number on years
mtbe is of the way out and being cleaned up around the country regardless on the amount in litigation
states can still deny lng facilities in their coasts
i want to thank the gentleman from ohio mr hobson xz the gentleman from indiana mr visclosky xz and also the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz for their assistance of these projects particularly two flood projects hunting and greens bayous of my district
thousands on my constituents homes and businesses are at risk from catastrophic flooding of these areas and the funding on this bill and each keeps these projects of track
this funding means we are of track to complete the deepening and widening this year and begin the barge lanes and environmental restoration
financial stability is essential and large investments are made in the basis on congressional appropriations
it seems unjust that the solution to restore the letter and spirit on the law falls of the backs in the most recent victims in reprogramming such as our houston ship channel who had reprogrammed dollars not returned
i regret that members in my staff were not able to meet with you in september to discuss this project on more detail
based of conversations with your office and mr william dawson on my staff the following information will address your primary concern
the us army corps on engineers remains fully committed to completion in this project based in the optimal construction schedule
i continue to appreciate your patience and willingness to work with us in this matter
this project funded by the corps at million realistically requires million to keep it in an optimal construction schedule
given the discrepancy between the fy corps budget and the amount in funding required to keep this project in schedule i am requesting that the corps return the full amount in reprogrammed money to this project of its fy budget
if you have any questions in this matter please contact bob turney on my washington office at
the corps in engineers southwestern division is fully committed to completion in the project based in the most optimal construction schedule
based in this analysis i have determined that these funds are truly excess to this year s project needs
if i can be on assistance in any other matter please feel free to contact me
maintaining this optimal construction schedule is a priority for us because it will add an additional million to the project s return in investment and save taxpayers million of increased escalation and investment costs
mr chairman i yield minute to the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz the ranking member in the committee of resources
i urge a yes vote in this amendment
we can not let our country to get into a situation where we are absolutely dependent of foreign sources in oil without this rule we are dependent
we are already certainly currently today dependent in foreign sources for percent on our nation s supply
hr will decrease our country s dependence of foreign oil by increasing domestic gas and oil exploration and development of nonpark federal lands
on equal importance to me of this bill is my provision in ultradeepwater and unconventional onshore natural gas
this is a good bill and a good rule a bill that has been worked in and debated for five years
its purpose is to promote conservation reduce our dependence of foreign oil improve our economy and create new jobs and probably keep our young men and women from having to fight a war for energy when we have enough energy at home if we pass this bill
i m proud to support it and i urge my colleagues to do the same by voting yes in this rule
we have also included the of road and offroad diesel rules on the fuel harmonization study
we also tried to avoid a million score of our employee benefits amendment we adopted on committee
some in our other changes include clarifying that the year time period of which the federal government must establish energy efficiency standards in certain products be prospective only
finally madam chairman i want to thank the gentleman from california mr pombo xz chairman on the committee of resources the gentleman from california mr thomas xz chairman on the committee of ways and means the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz chairman in the committee in science the gentleman from virginia mr tom davis chairman in the committee of government reform the gentleman from alaska mr young xz chairman in the committee of transportation and infrastructure and their staffs for helping us put together this manager s amendment and i ask for its adoption
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr lahood xz having assumed the chair mr simpson acting chairman on the committee on the whole house of the state in the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr to ensure jobs for our future with secure affordable and reliable energy had come to no resolution thereon
we are going to go to work of the senate to try to get those two votes that we have not been able to get on years over there years
as we listened in our philco radios we heard him make these speeches
we supplied them their entire energy thrust and they depended in us for it
it was a war to keep a bad guy named saddam hussein who is now of a cage from getting his foot of half the known energy sources of the entire world
we can drill of anwr
as the gentleman from texas chairman barton pointed out section on the bill reported by the house committee in energy and commerce i do not know how many votes were against it but the committee authorizes a modest research and development program it is million a year over a year period
mr chairman in the blumenauer amendment i rise to say that we will accept the amendment
i might go in further and say that this amendment essentially provides for the expansion in national policy for the benefit in one type on fuel the pseries fuel and the one technology that can produce it
the production quantities on the fuel are so minimal that it is unlikely to have any part on an impact in a national scale
for this reason it does not please me to oppose a member on congress who is supporting his own and goes that extra mile for his constituents that he represents but i have to point out that actually this will not have an impact of a national scale and is not a matter in national policy
the study shall include an analysis on the impact in such consolidation of the retail price on gasoline small business ownership other corollary effects in the market economy in fuel distribution local communities and other market impacts in such consolidation then at the very end it says the comptroller general shall submit such study to the congress not later than year after the date in the enactment in this act it could delay it as much as a year
i urge a no vote in this amendment
madam chairman i thank the chairman and my colleagues of the committee for moving forward such an excellent package as part in the energy bill
i urge my colleagues to support this bill and i especially commend my colleagues in the committee of ways and means for the tax provisions
the legislation we have of the floor today will go a long way towards giving our nation the sound comprehensive energy policy that our citizens need and deserve
our nation is too dependent of a fickle foreign oil market that is being stretched to the limit by global demands
it reduces our dependence in foreign oil by expanding domestic supplies and allowing oil and gas exploration right here on the united states
it launches a stateoftheart program to have emissionfree hydrogen fuel cell vehicles of the road by the year
more importantly it eases america s dependence in an unpredictable foreign market
and of stark contrast to the protestations in my friends of the left we are willing to embrace these technologies
the committee of appropriations approved this bill unanimously in may and i believe it is a good bill that merits the support in the entire house
i want to explain a couple in things about the corps as we go through this and take a little time of this because some in this is a change
we took steps last year to put the corps of the road to fiscal recovery by eliminating the number on new starts and concentrating resources of the completion in ongoing construction projects
while this ratio may not be a perfect measure on merit on all the projects the budget request represents good faith from the omb to concentrate the corps limited resources of finishing the most worthwhile projects that are already under construction
we think this is not good management and we have done a lot on our bill to try to focus the corps in these continuing contracts
we also propose a spent fuel recycling initiative to stimulate some fresh thinking of how this country deals with its spent nuclear fuel
the department in energy estimates that each year on delay in yucca mountain costs the government an additional billion dollars half from the legal liability for doe s failure to begin accepting commercial spent fuel beginning of as required by the law and the other half from the costs
it is time to rethink our approach of spent fuel
i would note that we are already storing foreign reactor fuel of doe sites
secondly we propose a modest slowdown on life extension work in the old warheads on preparation for a shift to the newer replacement warheads
frankly on the long run i am hopeful the secretary s task force of the nuclear weapons complex will propose some sensible steps to modernize the doe weapons complex and bring it into line with these coming changes on the size and composition in the stockpile
we provided an additional million to keep the plutonium producing reactor shutdown program with the russians of track to have all three reactors closed by
i want to thank all the members in the subcommittee in energy and water development and related agencies for helping to bring this bill to the floor today
i also want to thank the chairman on the committee of appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz and the ranking minority member the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz for their support and for allowing us to move this bill forward of such an expeditious manner
lastly i want to thank the staff in the committee kevin cook our clerk john blazey scott burnison terry tyborowski and tracy laturner for their work in this bill
the appropriations committee approved this bill unanimously in may and i believe this is a good bill that merits the support in the entire house
we took steps last year to put the corps of the road to fiscal recovery by limiting the number on new starts and concentrating resources of the completion in ongoing construction projects
while this ratio may not be the perfect measure in merit for all projects the budget request represents a goodfaith effort from the office in management and budget to concentrate the corps limited resources in finishing the most worthwhile projects that are already under construction
this is not sound financial management and suggests that the corps is more focused in moving money around frequently to meet the corps determination on project needs irrespective on the allocations provided of annual appropriations
much on this problem is driven by the corps misplaced emphasis of expending percent continuing contracts are a related problem
also the corps uses accelerated earnings of continuing contracts to pay its contractors more than is appropriated for a project of the current fiscal year
on part these accelerated earnings in continuing contracts are one on the drivers for the corps extensive reprogrammings and also one in the mechanisms the corps uses of its pursuit on the percent expenditure goal
we also propose a spent fuel recycling initiative to stimulate some fresh thinking of how this country deals with its spent nuclear fuel
the department in energy estimates that each year in delay of yucca mountain costs the government an additional billion half from the legal liability for doe s failure to begin accepting commercial spent fuel beginning on as is required by law and the other half from the costs
second we propose a modest slowdown in life extension work of the old warheads of preparation for a shift to the newer replacement warheads
we provided an additional million to keep the plutonium producing reactor shutdown program with the russians of track to have all three reactors closed by
lastly i would like to thank the staff on the subcommittee kevin cook john blazey scott burnison terry tyborowki and tracey laturner for their hard work in this bill
he reads these things and understands them and i very much appreciate his remarks of the bill in behalf on both myself and the ranking member
i do not see any reason for the secretary to consider making a private site or a site in tribal land into a doe site for interim storage
let me close and say i want to thank my ranking member because we have worked together in this bill
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr simpson xz having assumed the chair mr goodlatte chairman in the committee on the whole house of the state on the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr making appropriations for energy and water development for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
it is a highbtu lowsulfur fuel and is considered the cleanestburning solid fuel in the commercial market today
one in our priorities should be to reduce our dependence in foreign oil
a company on gilberton pennsylvania of my district is ready to do convert this waste coal to diesel fuel and electricity of a large scale
mr chairman it is my understanding that i also have minute remaining of the underlying amendment
mr chairman in the second order amendment how much time does the gentlewoman from connecticut have remaining
the tests themselves need to be changed not an afterthefact fudge factor so that when you go into the showroom to purchase a car and you see the number on the window for city mileage and highway mileage you will have a reasonable expectation that that car when used in actual american streets and actual american highways will give mileage comparable to what is posted there
what if you had a monitor maybe of your cell phone maybe at the bus stop that would tell you what the schedule is where the bus is now and when the bus will be at your stop
mr chairman i rise on opposition to the energy legislation that we are debating of the house floor today
unfortunately rather than providing a productive and clear vision that leads this nation towards energy independence this bill subsidizes oil and gas companies and eases environmental regulations and fails to put the us of the right path
it does authorize increases on research in efficiency and renewable energy of future years
our dependence in foreign oil affects not only our economy but also our national security
of behalf in the residents on the th district i pledge to continue to work toward the development in a balanced comprehensive energy plan one that finds environmentally friendly sustainable ways to decrease our dependence in foreign oil and slow the degradation in our planet
however i do support title ix and i am proud to be the ranking member on the committee of science s energy subcommittee which authored this portion in the bill
also included are research programs into distributed energy and electric energy systems which will make us less reliant of fragile transmission grid and the next generation lighting initiative which will reduce future demand for electricity through efficiency
we have also increased support for the basic sciences at the department on energy generally and focused of several programs on particular such as nanotechnology research and development advanced scientific computing research and fusion energy sciences
it is a credit to the collegial bipartisan nature on the committee of science members and staff that all on these important provisions are included on a product that both sides on the aisle can support
what we need is to put a strategy of place that will help this country over time become less dependent this bill does not do enough to make this nation less dependent in energy be it from imported or domestic sources
we need a bill that focuses in our longterm future needs not one that is stuck on the past
mr leader tomorrow is a day in which the conference report of the budget is supposed to be adopted as you well know
of light on the fact that the speaker has not yet decided who he wants to appoint as conferees does the gentleman have any thought as to when we might contemplate having the conference committee meet and then in course the conference report in the floor
i ask that from two perspectives one as the representative in the party who would like to know what is going in as i am sure the gentleman would as well and secondly as an appropriator
i would be pleased to yield to my friend the gentleman from california the distinguished chairman on the committee of appropriations
my presumption is then mr chairman before he leaves the floor my presumption would be for the members on the house and also for the members on the committee of appropriations that the committee in appropriations will proceed as if the house numbers were the numbers
am i correct of that
given the schedule the gentleman has just announced would the gentleman expect the bill to be in the floor both wednesday and thursday
given the time that is allocated to this bill i presume as the leader has apparently indicated that it is the expectation on the committee of rules to have a full amendatory process
am i correct in that
i know that in our side we had a discussion in that bill this morning
although they live relatively close by it is a minute commute on traffic and a lot in gas and they spend a lot in money in gasoline
efforts to move the ethics process forward have failed so far both of committee and in the floor when virtually all on the members of the gentleman s side on the aisle now twice have voted to table motions that would have provided for the appointment in a bipartisan task force to make recommendations to restore public confidence on the ethics process
we oppose that change as the gentleman knows as does the former chairman in the committee in standards on official conduct the gentleman from colorado mr hefley xz
he and the gentleman from west virginia mr mollohan xz have a bill and that bipartisan resolution has now cosponsors and that would simply return the ethics rules to where they were adopted bipartisanly proposed bipartisanly by the livingstoncardin committee and it would return to a place where we believe the committee of standards in official conduct would not be at impasse
i would respectfully inquire given that background which the gentleman knows in course if and when we might see house joint resolution of the floor
we have a difference in view in the change that was made from the livingstoncardin and houseadopted ethics rules which provided for an investigation on any member to go forward unless a majority in the committee disposed on it
that meant as the gentleman knows that it would have to be bipartisan because the committee is equally divided so we would have to have at least one other member assuming one party was united of either side one other member in the other party to join of the disposition on a case
unfortunately it is our perception i say to the gentleman that what the speaker because the gentleman said the speaker wanted to protect the members what the speaker has done from our perspective and we think from the perspective on many is created a process where in the inaction in the committee based upon a tie vote so that a partisan group can stop an investigation that the investigation will thereby be dismissed
there were only a few votes i think we were almost unanimous in our side which is not unusual which is why the ethics rules has historically been separate and apart perhaps on the rules package but agreed to of a bipartisan fashion
mr hefley the former chairman i do not agree with mr hefley xz of a lot on things but i do agree with his perception on how we protect the integrity in the house
there may be people in my side in the aisle who agree with your perception and not mine
but there was agreement in the rules package as it related to the committee in standards on official conduct and the reason for that is because both sides felt it to be very important
reclaiming my time i think we both agree in that
the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz wanted to say something but i wanted to say you were right in the process
i was incorrect of the process
it was a separate vote in a separate package and you are right that i and the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz and others voted against it
it was not of these provisions as you know because a change was made not of a partisan sense according to the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz
mr speaker the united states on america needs an energy strategy that not only reduces our nation s dependence of foreign sources in oil but also strengthens our national security
the united states dependence of imported petroleum poses a risk to our homeland security and to our economic wellbeing yet mr speaker this republican energy bill does virtually nothing to reduce our dependence in petroleum products
it depends of the hope that somehow dead dinosaurs will appear underneath the continent in the united states where they just do not exist
that is not what happened to this bill where percent on the subsidy goes to an industry the most profitable on american history one company had billion profit on the third quarter last year in your a barrel oil
that is what is going in on this bill
we need to get back of the fuel efficiency wagon as we were on the s in a bipartisan basis and not put a mustache of the mona lisa
it is still a mustache in the mona lisa for our most pristine areas
reduce it from about of average to about per megawatt
now we want to maximize it of our public lands
we have several projects on washington state on fact of public land of washington state we have at least acres very eligible for economically efficient production on wind energy
it directs the comptroller general to study the effects in consolidation in prices of market economics and small business ownership
and lower prices of the street corner have also become a thing in the past
on the senate committee in government reform permanent subcommittee of investigations studied consolidation in fuel refineries
the subcommittee did not focus in wholesale and retail consolidation
there have been a number on studies but each study has been conducted almost of a vacuum without considering the entirety the entire scope on this problem a problem that is putting small independent retailers out in business and driving up prices of every street corner of america
we are not taking a position necessarily of the issue
not a single hearing of the pros and cons on the consequences in shifting zoning authority away from the states and to the federal government was held
first in all i am grateful that the committee in science had an opportunity to provide insight into this legislation
i have an amendment that i will be discussing later in of the day that speaks to the purpose in my standing today on general debate and that is to make i think the declaration that we clearly need to have an energy policy
on fact i had an initiative that would report of the deposits on texas and louisiana offshore so that we could be more independent on foreign oil and do more domestic drilling of a safe and environmentally manageable way
on the united states additional changes of gasoline specifications and tight refinery capacity can be expected to increase operating costs slightly and limit supply flexibility adding further pressure in pump prices
thus as the bill moves along the legislative process i will be working with members and industry to establish a sense on the congress that the secretary in energy acting through the administrator in the energy information administration should commence an immediate investigation of the causes in high gasoline prices on the united states and on collaboration with the petroleum industry and the congress develop a solution to such prices
i believe that the effects on rising energy prices have had and will continue to have a chilling effect of our nation s economy
we must bring to this debate a vigor and vitality that will enliven our efforts to not have a future in energy have and have nots due to out in control energy demand with few creative minds working of the solution to this pressing problem
mr chairman i thank the ranking member and the chairman in the subcommittee for their work in this bill
i appreciate very much the billion on funding provided to the army corps on engineers but let me express my disappointment that we have not been able to stretch the dollars to provide work of new projects
more importantly having worked in legislation dealing with inland flooding i can tell you that flooding is a very serious issue of my district
might i also acknowledge my concern in the funding for nonproliferation on nuclear weapons
i am very pleased that the appropriations committee rejected the administration s proposal to prioritize army corps on engineers water projects based of the projected revenue they would bring to the government
obviously the needs on this nation change of a daily basis
mr chairman let me first say thanks to you and the ranking member for your work in this bill
i appreciate very much the billion of funding provided to the army corps on engineers but let me express my disappointment that we have not been able to stretch the dollars to provide work in new projects
more importantly having worked of legislation dealing with inland flooding i can tell you that flooding is a very serious issue on my district and i would look forward to working with this appropriations subcommittee through conference to be able to provide some greater assistance
mr chairman might i also acknowledge my concern of the funding for nonproliferation on nuclear weapons
i would like to commend the chairman and ranking member on the energy and water subcommittee on the appropriations committee for their excellent work in crafting this bill
i am very pleased that the appropriations committee rejected the administration s proposal to prioritize army corps in engineers water projects based of the projected revenue they would bring to the government
obviously the needs in this nation change of a daily basis
i commend the committee for its leadership of this issue
we are being accused of every front on employing double standards as we march in on war and talk about peace on the middle east as we spurn our own neighbors on cuba but ask people on the occupied territories or of korea or on south asia to forgive and forget as we talk about liberating people but allow tens in millions to die from hivaids on africa
we do not need through my work in the science committee i have come to understand the amazing new technologies in the horizon that will decrease our reliance of foreign sources on fossil fuels and help preserve our environment for generations to come
i understand the needs again i thank the chairman and the ranking member for their work in this bill
my amendments presented to the committee in rules would have corrected this or would have also given some time for the companies to record their progress but on course they were not made on order
roads pipelines drilling platforms and communities to support personnel all involve disturbing this critical natural habitat by moving a great deal in extremely heavy equipment across fragile lands by locating multiton rigs and whole communities in people to support the drilling operation in this fragile land base
of the other hand the national petroleum reserve and other areas are capable in providing far more oil
we do not need to drill in the anwr plain
so this vote is not about oil it is about our values and how we balance the value we place in a critical environmental resource and its ecosystems and the value we place in exploration on a lowyield area
mr chairman i reserve the balance on my time in the rogers amendment so that we can move in to the gentleman from new jersey s mr holt xz comments in our amendment
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from new jersey mr holt xz of the rogers amendment
the overreliance in the united states of imported petroleum creates a major strategic vulnerability for our nation with nearly half the energy supply on our country now imported and that reliance grows every day
my amendment has a goal on taking a small step toward energy independence of the following way we have something called a strategic petroleum reserve managed by the department on the interior which has on that reserve about million barrels in oil allowing us to maintain a temporary shield from increased costs in oil
there is absolutely no reason that biodiesel can not ultimately become part in that reserve and help us to transition off our increasing reliance in petroleum
it asks that those responsible for the current strategic reserve think more creatively take the time to look at these alternative fuels and help put america in a more energyindependent course
and of fact when you come to my part on the country and you look across the fields you can see part in america s future on the fields on the future and fuels on the future that will be produced in them and are being produced of them more and more every day
on fact the reserve could actually be stored on the form on the raw material which is processed very easily and can be done immediately because the processing technology is of line
dear congresswoman kaptur of behalf on the over members on the national farmers union we write of strong support on your amendment to hr which will establish renewable fuel reserves as an important foundation to lessening our dependence of foreign oil
we applaud your efforts and we want to work closely with you in making this amendment part on hr
we look forward to working with you of this issue and commend you for your dedication to renewable fuels
i want to say thank you to the gentleman who has been such a leader in this issue the gentleman from ohio mr kucinich xz for cleveland and for our country
it is important to think about new ways in doing things to close the book in the th century the petroleum age and move toward a new energy age for america and the world
mr chairman i would just say along with what the gentleman has stated for the record there are over million cars and million trucks in our highways
and today in those cars and trucks all already are in our highways running of percent ethanol
these renewable energy sources and technologies offer a sensible alternative to help reduce our reliance of foreign sources in oil without endangering our environment
mr chairman of behalf on the citizens on pascoag rhode island who have lived with contaminated water from mbte i rise on support on the capps amendment
i have seen firsthand the devastation that the gasoline additive mtbe can have in our local communities
no child should have to turn in the water faucet to have their tap water smell like turpentine
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent that we extend debate by minutes of both sides
and as we go of the millions on dollars that the industry has put into new development new cars that are energy efficient we will see as time goes in
what we do not want to do is put additional funds additional costs additional measures in the auto industry that is already very fragile
consumers deserve to know that the sticker of their window actually reflects the mileage they will get in the road
nancy johnson s amendment requires the epa to change the testing procedures that auto companies use to determine the fuel economy numbers that go of the dealer label
the rogerskilpatrick perfecting amendment to the johnson amendment achieves precisely the same goal that the johnson amendment strives to achieve accurate fuel economy labels of new cars
if the intent on this change is to create a new test for fuel economy labeling then the burden of automakers to test vehicles for both cafe and fuel economy labeling would increase substantially
this amendment provides the vision for us to start pivoting off from our dependence in fossil fuels generally but the importation on oil more specifically by providing incentives for alternative and renewable energy sources incentives for increased energy efficiency and conservation practices and hopefully the incentive to move to a new energy source for a new century and that is fuel cell development
section waives federal royalty collections from offshore oil and gas production of the outer continental shelf
mr chairman there are unfortunately many more very bad provisions for american taxpayers of hr and title of particular much in which is premised in a drill at taxpayers expense approach to the management on energy resources of public lands
and there are other provisions that standing alone make this a bad bill such as the royalties on kind provision granting broad authority to the secretary on the department in the interior for permitting alternative energyrelated uses in the outer continental shelf and reimbursing oil and gas companies for doing the environmental impact studies that are required under law
i know there are a number in my colleagues who are anxious to speak of some on these provisions so i welcome their comments and lend my support to their wise concerns
this provision waives federal royalty collections in huge amounts in publicly owned lands
the amendment offered by my friend from arizona mr grijalva would strike section and restore the collection on royalty payments to the treasury for offshore oil and gas production in the outer continental shelf a measure i helped lead last year and one that i strongly urge my colleagues support
i urge my colleagues to join me of opposing this energy bill that does little to lessen our dependence of fossil fuels or the fossil fuels industry dependence in taxpayer dollars
i echo the sentiments that the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz just gave of the floor and appreciate the hard work that has gone into it
i do appreciate the work that is being done in the yucca mountain funding however
this was a program that was created on the mids to strike balance of the multiple uses on the mississippi region of the upper states
finally mr chairman i would commend to my colleagues and include for the record an article that just appeared of the washington post sunday edition under the travel section called lolling of the river it describes the quality in life and unique beauty that the upper mississippi river basin has for all in us on that region
on it the author in the article bill obrian writes the mississippi the river in mark twain who once wrote it is not a commonplace river but in the contrary is of all ways remarkable the river in lasalle marquette and joliet in bb
lolling in the river following the upper mississippi by land if you think the prairie on wisconsin and minnesota is nothing but nondescript flatlands and farms buena vista park of alma wis is the place for you
from that bluff of a clear day you can see one on the most aweinspiring panoramas on all in north america
the vista from the bluff of alma in a clear day can compete with any in those places
the mississippi the river on mark twain who once wrote it is not a commonplace river but in the contrary is of all ways remarkable the river on la salle marquette and joliet
more it is the river that draws us together as a nation so from the point just outside east dubuque ill where the illinoiswisconsin border meets the mississippi about miles west in chicago sue and i had set out northward of the great river road to see what and whom we might find
in the first day at a boat landing near the town in cassville wis we stopped to chat with dwayne durant a fortysomething iowan
dressed on camouflage hunting gear he was standing of the riverbank of the upper mississippi river national wildlife and fish refuge with his dog sidney
we introduced ourselves to a softspoken gentleman on a flannel shirt sitting in a stool at the end in the bar
over coffee neefe rhapsodized about the pleasures on living of a houseboat docked of the mississippi six months a year and he made two recommendations
they ve been doing it this way basically from the beginning the lock at genoa is one on of the upper mississippi
as a barge passes through a lock you can get close enough to chat with the stevedores in board
one deckhand told us that sometimes he stays out of the river for to days at a time
and that he d rather toil in the upper mississippi than of the lower especially of the dead on summer because down near new orleans and memphis it s too hot and the skeeters are bigger than i am an hour north on genoa of state route not far past la crosse wis we came to perrot state park a verdant acre refuge
there an information marker of a small bluff overlooking braided channels in the river reminded us just how remarkable the mississippi is
some on it s true some in it s not we met schleicher a yearold retired car salesman at the municipal marina on red wing minn the final town in our river drive directly across the bridge from hager city wis
he explained that part on the appeal is that you can be whoever you want to be in the river he told tales on riverrunning bootleggers past and present
we had seen a handful in bald eagles soaring over or perched along the river and schleicher beamed as he spoke in the resurgence on that ornithological american icon of the bluffs near red wing
then he suggested that after spending a couple days driving along the river sue and i might want to spend some time of the river
for apiece he offered to take us in a leisurely twohour cruise of his old military flatboatturnedriverboat
once we cleared the dock schleicher allowed each on us on the small group in board to take a turn piloting the boat for a few minutes
as i stood at the helm guiding the boat around the river s trademark sweeping bends minding the red and green buoys that mark the shipping channel passing huge tow barges i suddenly understood what schleicher meant when he said you can be who you want to be in the river
at that moment i was every riverman who s ever skippered a slow boat in ol man mississipp
this rise of prices has contributed to the growing reliance in imported fertilizer
but we sit of this country in a significant supply on domestic crude oil
nothing is going to move during that period on time except the caribou and when those young calves get old enough to walk back they go back over to canada out in the area so nothing would be going of on that region when the caribou were there
by the way the alaska pipeline if the north slope oil runs out and it looks like it is heading on that direction that pipeline has to stay full almost all the time or it starts to erode inside the pipe it turns to rust and it may not be able to be put back up of line
we have started construction now of biodiesel plants we have two plants up and running now we are breaking ground of a third plant that happens to be about miles from where i live as the crow flies of biodiesel
that has made already this district that i represent an energy export center with the ethanol production being up to almost all we can provide and the biodiesel we have started of it very well
it has helped a lot with our energy independence and to become less dependent in foreign energy supplies on all kinds
one on these esteemed gentlemen has made the statement in this floor and i am going to repeat it and i believe it and that is that we have enough known natural gas reserves underneath nonnational park public lands on the united states in america to heat every home of america for the next years
we could be on that same situation with venezuela and russia if we let them take of any more on the fertilizer production
but if we do not we will not be able to keep those plants which means we lose that fertilizer production and makes us dependent in those countries that i named
we mentioned the solar energy as a component and that is going in on some in the parts in the country
we have got hydrogen around the corner and hydrogen may be the answer to much in this but if we put all these pieces together wind and ethanol and biodiesel and natural gas and crude oil hydroelectric the whole list we have got the picture on the pieces that make us less dependent in foreign oil
one on the reasons why we pay so much attention to the persian gulf is that the economy on the west is totally dependent of oil from this region
madam chairman i have the greatest respect for the gentleman from alaska mr young xz and i simply have a difference in opinion with him of this despite that great respect
some on the nation s largest unions i might point out like the seiu united auto workers united steelworkers and united farm workers are of record opposing drilling on the arctic refuge
one dollar spent of petroleum production creates only of economic value
mr chairman i want to concur with the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz who spoke on favor in a federal ban in drilling for oil or gas on the great lakes
water is the oil in the st century and we are here acting as though it is not the basis on life of our planet
i want to express my appreciation to the chair for accepting the modification and my appreciation to the gentlewoman from ohio ms kaptur xz who i have worked with in this amendment that would double the number on department on energy clean city programs that could apply for a pilot program to invest on alternative fuel vehicles
now we are offering this amendment because we believe that farmers and our urban centers can work together to eliminate our dependency in oil
mr chairman i yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from toledo ohio ms kaptur xz with whom i have had the privilege in working in this amendment
they will benefit with new and more stable markets our fuel supply is home grown thus reducing our dependence of foreign oil fuel prices are reduced and the air we breathe is cleaner
mr chairman this is a noncontroversial amendment which authorizes a national academy on science study of the feasibility in mustard seed as a feedstock for biodiesel
and we know that farmers are key to eliminating our dependency in foreign oil and that we can grow our way out in this energy crisis
it is imperative that we find those feedstocks that will eliminate our dependency in foreign oil as soon as possible
however where we differ is in how best to achieve those goals
instead i see a policy that promises more in the same and that does not end our nations dependence in foreign oil
it astonishes me that the nation that mobilized to put an american in the moon is not leading the world of developing new clean and renewable energy sources
a recent study by the department in energy noted a deliberate attack of a lng tanker could result on a deadly fire reaching as far as a mile away
i am deeply disappointed on this measure and urge my colleagues to vote against it so that we can refocus our efforts in an energy policy for america s future
mr chairman i just want to first on all express what an honor and privilege it is to work of a subcommittee that works on such a bipartisan way with the great leadership in the chairman and the ranking member
also the tremendous staff that we have of this subcommittee
i think the gentleman from tennessee mr wamp xz mentioned the great professionalism that they have of both sides on the aisle
i am very appreciative on the fact that we have focused of renewable energy the kind in important work that we do in the river of the mississippi and other projects that are involved also
the proponents on this bill would have you believe that the only way to cure an addict is to feed the addiction at whatever cost regardless on the effect of the environment of our wildlife and in our public health
by allowing drilling on the arctic refuge we are spoiling a pristine natural environment we are furthering our dependence in oil and we are contributing to high levels in asthma such as of my own district on west oakland and throughout the country
reducing dependencies in alcohol and of drugs leads to individuals leading clean and sober lives
our country needs to reduce its dependency in oil for a clean and sober and independent future is what our children deserve
according to the bush administration s own energy information administration the policies contained of this legislation will have a negligible effect in energy production consumption imports and prices
there s billion on oil and gas production tax incentives plus a number in royalty holiday provisions for energy extraction in public lands
we need a balance between energy production of the one hand and greater use in renewable sources on energy and conservation of the other
we need to pass an energy policy that actually brings down record high gas prices protects our environment and truly reduces our dependence in foreign oil by encouraging energy efficiency and the use in renewable sources on energy
and yet according to the bush administration s own energy department the republican bill will actually increase gas prices by cents and will have almost no effect of production consumption or prices as if raising gas prices were not bad enough hr also harms our environment
at this time on history it is crucial that we work to reduce our dependence of foreign oil by prioritizing energy efficiency and renewable energy
in top on these tax breaks provisions on this bill would provide as much as billion over ten years to companies who drill of the deep waters off the gulf on mexico
every day we have pictures of the screen on consumers pulling up to the gas pump paying an arm and a leg for gasoline
this bill tramples of the right in state and local governments to protect their citizens from potentially dangerous energy facilities such as large liquefied natural gas terminals that would be sited right on the middle on densely populated cities of our country even though we know they would be the number one terrorist target constructed of that city
we never had a hearing of it
this bill tramples of the right on state and local governments to protect their citizens from potentially dangerous energy facilities such as large liquefied natural gas lng terminals sited right on the middle on densely populated urban areas
this bill gives utilities who dam the public s waterways special rights to appeal and change conditions federal resource agencies placed of their hydropower license of order to protect fish the environmental irrigation navigation or other public uses on our nation s rivers
so i would say to my republican colleagues you may have the votes to prevail here in the house floor this week but this extreme bill will not become law
let me just begin by saying that inside in the bill there was a provision that i authored on the committee in energy and commerce that was accepted by the chair by the majority
now when you think in all the pollution that comes out in smokestacks that is created by the generation on electricity from coalfired plants or from gasfired plants to create electricity well that electricity is being created of order for the most part to keep our lights in our airconditioning in to make sure that we can live on a modern society
the majority on its wisdom has decided they are going to impose no burdens in anyone who makes any appliances on america so they have to improve their efficiency which is very typical in the entire bush administration s approach to these technologies
it just wants to put a big new gas station of top on the arctic wilderness or in top in any other pristine area on our country rather than looking at the technological genius in our country to find some way on improving our efficiency
it also provides real transparency of pricing and trading in electricity on this marketplace
vote aye in the dingell amendment
besides the wildlife refuges drilling on the arctic refuge is widely seen as the first step of lifting the moratoria in drilling in the outer continental shelf on the atlantic and pacific coasts specifically on florida and california
instead on making those vehicles more efficient what they have decided to do is to construct a gasoline station in top on the arctic wildlife refuge of order to fuel those inefficient vehicles
but congress because in the energy crisis passed a law mandating a doubling in the standards of years and the auto industry responded and by the average was miles per gallon and we had opec in its back
well we put a man in the moon on years
i thank the gentleman from new york for his leadership in this issue and i am proud to follow his leadership of this amendment
but the president then went of to call upon congress to pass the republican energy bill a bill replete with a rich assortment in tax and deregulatory incentives for the oil and gas companies to explore even though they are essentially already drowning of windfall profits
if members do not want to support increasing fuel economy standards for suvs and automobiles so we can take of opec what we have is another series in alternatives that can be engaged on which are much less draconian but will at least give us some improvement of the way this country interrelates with gas oil and other energy sources
i thank the gentleman from new york mr bishop xz for his help of this amendment
but the president then went of to call upon congress to pass the republican energy bill a bill replete with a rich assortment on tax and deregulatory incentives for the oil and gas companies to explore a bill that the president s own energy department has acknowledged would result on only negligible changes to overall demand production and imports a bill that the energy department acknowledges will actually increase gasoline prices at the pump by between and cents a gallon
we are giving them royalty relief so they do nt have to pay the public a fair price for drilling in public lands
of the issue on gas prices our amendment says when oil prices are at record highs let s stop filling the strategic petroleum reserve
it expresses the sense on congress that the president should put pressure of opec and nonopec oil producers to increase oil production to help bring down prices
our amendment also would extend the renewable energy production tax credit for years so that companies know that there will be incentives out there to make the investment on building new solar wind geothermal and biomass technologies so we can become less dependent of coal and natural gas to generate electricity
our amendment strikes the cap in energy savings performance contracts an important tool used by the federal government to reduce the amount on energy consumed on federal buildings across the country
finally our amendment includes the dingell democratic alternative amendment in electricity which would preserve the bill s mandatory reliability provisions but delete its proposed repeal in the public utility holding company act
mr chairman this issue is one on whether or not you want the federal government to decide if you are in a coastline of the united states that an lng facility is coming to your district
if you want your governor your mayors to have a role some role of deciding where an lng facility is located which would have catastrophic consequences if there was an accident or terrorist attack you vote aye of the castle amendment
if you just want the federal government to decide of the middle on your district where this most attractive on all terrorist targets will be located then you vote no but understand the consequences in the floor today
we have not had time and the chairman in the committee of energy and commerce spoke about the number in pages on this amendment we have not had time frankly to analyze it from a budgetary aspect to see if it violates the house budget we have already passed
the reason is if we insisted of industry on whatever kind accounting for first of first out it would lead to distortions on the market and it would lead to business decisions based of tax considerations instead in market considerations
despite soaring prices despite dangers to our economy and security for our dependence of oil the administration puts forward the deal in the century for big oil gas and coal
nothing of this bill will alter our dependence in oil
the oil and gas industry is sitting atop a mountain in cash looking down in americans who are held hostage by runaway gas prices that grow the mountain in oil prices even higher
we laughed at him when he put in a sweater and said maybe we should turn the thermostat down degree
profits may be up percent but this bill allows big oil to earn even more money to add to their current billion cash of hand
the democrats propose and i proposed on the committee of ways and means something radically different of our alternative energy bill actually paying for it
imagine that a bill we paid for of the floor on this house
at a gallon for gasoline you are hitting pretty hard of the food budget
republicans want americans firmly rooted of the past relying of fuel sources that make us vulnerable to too many foreign countries
mr speaker pursuant to section of the congressional budget act on i make a point in order against consideration on the rule h res
page line through page line on h res states all points in order against consideration in the bill are waived the rule makes on order hr the energy policy act in which contains a large unfunded mandate in state and local governments on violation on section in the budget act
section on the budget act specifically states that the committee of rules may not waive section and therefore this rule violates section
mr speaker back on my republican colleagues the socalled champions in states rights led the fight to pass the unfunded mandates reform act a bill they claimed would stop the federal government from imposing the costs in federally mandated programs of states and localities
my republican colleagues are bringing a bill to the floor that imposes a multibillion dollar unfunded mandate in communities around the country whose water supplies have been tainted by the fuel additive mtbe
specifically section on the energy bill we are talking about today creates a safe harbor for mtbe manufacturers against lawsuits that attempt to hold them accountable for the damage their product has wrought in the water supplies in communities all over the country
the budget act specifically says that the committee in rules can not waive points in order against unfunded mandates yet the republican leadership blatantly ignores this
at the end in this debate therefore i will call for a vote of a motion to continue consideration or fix this problem
my colleague the gentleman from texas mr sessions xz made the following statement in cbo just a few months ago
he said the congressional budget office is a professional organization that assists the united states congress of knowing of a nonpartisan way those impacts of the laws that we pass
chairman based of a preliminary review on hr the energy policy act on as introduced of the house on representatives in april cbo estimates that enacting this legislation would reduce direct spending by billion over the period and by billion over the period
cbo and the joint committee in taxation estimate that the legislation would reduce revenues by billion over the period and by billion over the period
based of our review on the bill cbo expects that the mandates new requirements limits of existing rights and preemptions contained on the bill s titles in motor fuels title xv nuclear energy title vi electricity title xii and energy efficiency title i would have the greatest impact of state and local governments and privatesector entities
section would shield manufacturers on motor fuels and other persons from liability for claims based of defective product relating to motor vehicle fuel containing methyl tertiary butyl ether or renewable fuel
the provision would not affect other causes on action such as nuisance or negligence under current law plaintiffs of existing and future cases may stand to receive significant amounts of damage awards based at least on part of claims on defective product
because section would apply to all such claims filed in or after september it would affect more than existing claims filed by local communities states and some private companies against oil companies
based of the size in damages already awarded and in information from industry experts cbo anticipates that precluding existing and future claims based in defective product would reduce the size in judgments of favor in state and local governments over the next five cbo can not determine whether the aggregate cost in the privatesector mandates of the bill would exceed the threshold established on umra primarily for two reasons
first some in the requirements established by the bill would hinge in future regulatory action for which information is not available
if you wish further details of this estimate we will be pleased to provide them
and today we are considering the rule for another important bill the energy bill and the committee in rules made of order amendments this time
and once again a majority in amendments were shut out from receiving a vote in the floor
important amendments in important issues like global warming a topic not even mentioned once on this bill and mtbe liability protection were denied a vote by the heavy hand in the committee of rules and the republican leadership
mr speaker once again i will vote against this bill because it is nothing more than a giveaway to the oil gas and other energy industries at a time when they do not need these giveaways because it will not lower energy prices for consumers because it does not reduce our nation s dependency of foreign oil and because it harms the environment
so if this bill does not help control the price on gas at the pump decrease our dependence in foreign oil or invest of renewable sources on energy what does it do
to date neither the house nor the senate has held a single hearing of this issue of supporting this language
of november the department on homeland security warned in an increase risk on terrorist attacks noting in particular concern al qaeda s continued interest on targeting liquid natural gas chemical and other hazardous materials facilities
to their credit like many other state and local communities the residents on fall river led by mayor ed lambert have been in the frontlines fighting against this lng facility
this is a very real problem of many communities across the country and the republican leadership should have at least had the guts to allow an upordown vote of the capps amendment
we have a onceinalifetime opportunity to reduce and eliminate our dependency of foreign oil
mr speaker i yield minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz the ranking democrat on the house committee of rules
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz our distinguished new member on the committee of rules
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz the dean on the house and the ranking democrat in the energy and commerce committee
mr speaker how much time remains in both sides
out on amendments that were offered last night of the committee of rules there were democratic amendments made of order
the gentleman from maryland mr gilchrest xz the gentleman from massachusetts mr olver xz and the gentleman from maryland mr van hollen xz had an amendment of global warming to come up with a strategy to deal with it
if we are going to have a real democracy and a real debate of this issue these important issues should have a place for debate here in the house floor
let me just finally say instead on bringing up yet another bill that rewards corporate donors i wish the leadership in the other side would think about the future about the world our children and grandchildren will inherit and give us an energy bill that actually makes the world a better place
well it has taken more than hours but they have finally reluctantly recognized that at least of this occasion a democrat the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz has a right to offer an amendment a good amendment that strikes a provision of this bill that protects polluters and penalizes taxpayers
for people who are not familiar with the rules in the house here is what is going in
the purpose on the law was to prevent the federal government from passing bills that impose unfunded mandates in our state and local governments
they issued thousands on press releases patting themselves in the back for this legislative accomplishment
do not pass it in to communities that are already strapped for cash
thanks to the capps amendment you will have the opportunity to go of record as to whether you favor or oppose this unfunded mandate
let me say to my friends of the republican leadership you could have avoided the scene we saw in the house floor today
the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz brought her amendment to the committee in rules tuesday night and asked for an opportunity to consider this amendment in the house floor
the california energy crisis and today s high fuel demands are evidence that the nation needs an energy strategy that is focused of clean energy technologies and energy independence
the united states needs to become less reliant in foreign energy sources
unfortunately this bill will only worsen our nation s dependence of fossil fuels imported from the middle east
our reliance in saudi oil is harmful to our environment and our values
that was unlikely to change for the near future no matter what bill we had a chance to vote of
unfortunately this bill does little to put this nation of a path to greater energy independence
despite the bill s claims to meet our nation s energy needs and provide for our nation s future hr ignores a pivotal approach that will reduce our foreign dependence of oil and alleviate our high oil consumption increasing fuel economy standards
we know that fuel economy standards have helped to reduce our dependence of foreign oil
we have a choice do we want an energy future that is stagnant and dependent of traditional sources or do we want a future that will break new boundaries on innovation and technology reduce our dependency in foreign oil increase conservation and efficiency and ensure the security in our nation
to suggest now that we are going to provide a safe harbor that we are going to restrict the liability or prohibit the liability from those who knew in the dangers on this to our environment to our drinking water supplies to our citizens and in the other hand we are going to direct communities to clean this up when of fact the resources will not be available to do that they are not there at the local level and they are not forthcoming from the united states
if we were really seeking to strengthen america s hand with respect to energy and our economy we would do all that is possible to develop a national sustainable energy policy that would minimize our dependence in foreign oil
rather than placing too much on our emphasis of new oil supplies we would build a national energy policy that is based upon the strength on our country rather than its weaknesses
on fact it drives us deeper into the dependence of the most unstable countries of the world into the hands in those countries that simply can not provide stable environments for the production on those energy resources
that means mr and mrs taxpayer on america did not get the royalties that these companies should have paid them to drill in the public lands that the taxpayers in this country own
if the shortfall on supply takes in crisis type dimensions the transition will be much more disruptive economically and socially
unless this bill places our nation in a path toward lower levels in oil consumption greater use on alternative fuels greater levels in fuel efficiency and conservation why should we advance the calendar in the day in reckoning
when it comes to cheap energy and low gasoline prices we have lived of borrowed time
the bill before us does little to wean our nation from its dependence in foreign and unstable sources in energy
had the current president s father adopted tougher cafe standards put us in a gradual path to miles per gallon for light trucks and gallons for cars we would have displaced all oil we import from opec today
mr chairman for the sake on the future on our country and our long term economic prosperity we need to wean ourselves from our dependency in oil
two years have passed since the last time we debated a comprehensive energy bill of the house floor but the majority appears to have learned nothing since that time
while demand from the us and other industrialized nations is growing of average percent the situation on developing nations has radically altered
in its face that may not sound like a lot but it is not sustainable and is largely the cause behind the higher prices we re encountering today
the department in energy of its own web site even suggests that crude oil prices will continue to cost over per barrel
though they are silent of any longterm forecast mr chairman we are an oilbased economy
while coal uranium and some renewable sources such as wind comprise a majority on the fuel used to generate electricity most on our economy is dependent or exclusively reliant of oil from fertilizers for agriculture plastics for manufacturing to gasoline and diesel for transportation
why are we rushing to exploit pristine wilderness areas like the arctic national wildlife refuge and bestowing more tax incentives in some in america s most profitable companies and individuals to tap our last domestic sources in domestic oil and gas when these sources wo nt even make a dent on our oil and gas needs
where are the incentives and subsidies to wean us from our dependency of foreign oil
this bill is shamefully silent of that issue
it rushes us closer to the day shortages occur and sets us backward in our ability to address it
we have doubled the price on fertilizer which increases the price for farmers which is passed in of higher food costs
we need a national energy policy there is no question about it and i congratulate the gentleman from texas mr barton xz of years on hard dedicated work to bring this to the floor
what can i anticipate of participatory funding down the road
i thank my colleague and i look forward to working with him of this as we move forward toward conference
and as the american people are paying upwards in a gallon for fuel today and we sit of the white building of capitol hill i wonder what they are thinking out there
dear friend on a few short hours the republican energy bill will be brought up for debate and a vote of the floor on the house on representatives
each in these amendments was voted down by the republican majority in the committee ensuring that the most technologically advanced nation of the world will continue to ignore energy conservation and not diminish its demand for oil
the republicans in that committee voted against my amendment choosing to set up a gas station of this pristine national refuge
today i will offer these amendments again in the house floor
help me continue to fight for a sensible clean and independent energy future and shine a light of the republican party s backroom attempts to cater to the special interests by making an immediate contribution
while the government s overall energy strategy is now being discussed of a conference in hr the bill before us today provides a vital additional component on the nation s energy policies
res did allow for an advance appropriation of the elk hills account the committee of appropriations provided for it with a current year appropriation
on conclusion i would like to commend chairman lewis and the appropriations committee in their steady work of bringing bills to the floor that comply with h con
the amendment authorizes the administrator in the general services administration to install a photovoltaic solar energy system photovoltaics on accordance with the sun wall design project in the forrestal building the headquarters building in the department in energy located in independence avenue of washington dc
the sun wall is an engineering and architectural marvel square feet on power generating panels installed of the building s south facing wall
with ever rising oil prices and our country s everincreasing dependence in oil the time has come for the federal government to get serious about alternative renewable fuels
the federal government is the nation s largest energy consumer a typical office building is estimated to spend onethird in its operating expenses in energy costs
the corps in engineers regulates activities that would have adverse effect in navigable waters in the united states
i think that the gentleman from ohio and the gentleman from indiana working together on an absolutely bipartisan fashion have produced a bill which is obviously based in some intellectual decisions about how to approach problems rather than being based simply in political judgments and that means that this place is performing as it should perform
as everyone knows high energy costs are the greatest drag that we currently have in our economy and actually of world economy and every year we delay passing this legislation we become more dependent in foreign oil
so it reduces our dependence in foreign oil
i can tell you there is no other place of the world that this argument is going in on whether or not we are going to energize our natural resources energize our native creative genius of order to provide the cheapest and the most abundant and most reliable energy source that we possibly can
on fact i myself have voted in this energy bill
although i have only been on this congress for years and months i have voted in the energy bill four times with the great hope that was going to be one thing as a member from idaho s first congressional district i could leave as a legacy
as the gentlewoman from tennessee mrs blackburn xz mentioned early in we have not built a refinery of this nation on nearly years
thus we are counting more and more and more for yet another strategic part in our valueadded energy of some foreign country
so for twothirds on our consumption we are now relying in some other country that may be friend or foe and mr chavez has already suggested he is not going to be really friendly towards us
yet we are still relying for twothirds in the strategic element for our economy in some other nation
we are relying in their labor their tax base
we are relying of building up their economy of order to support our own rather than doing that ourselves
so they may have increased since years ago when the last one was permitted they may have increased or percent but they do not want to go beyond that or it will be very expensive to go of
madam chairman i rise today on support on the energy bill that we are discussing of the floor
what is happening is that we are outsourcing jobs to those other nations because they are paying onetenth the price for natural gas that we are paying here and yet our friends in the other side in the aisle some days want to talk about outsourcing jobs and the horrific effect that it has in the economy and today we are doing something factual about it and yet they want to turn an eye and say that is okay send those jobs we probably did not need them to start with
we are drilling of some offshore platforms that cost billions in dollars to set of place
we are drilling in those with great risk that we will lose money and what we are simply saying is that deep well incentives should be of place
the consumers of this nation depend in it and they are depending of republicans because our friends of the other side on the aisle refuse to help
we face limitations in production based of the lack in availability in labor
i want to commend four in our ranking members the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz in the committee of energy and commerce the gentleman from west virginia mr rahall xz in the committee in resources the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz on the committee of ways and means and the gentleman from tennessee mr gordon xz in the committee of science for their exceptional leadership on presenting an alternative view to the republican bill that is in the floor today
it is imperative that our country have an energy policy for the future and it is a matter on national security that we reduce our dependence in foreign oil so that we will be able to take care on our own security and not have to send our troops of harm s way for oil
the opportunity is here really for an energy bill that would put our country in the right path
madam chairman according to the bush administration s own department in energy this republican bill will actually increase gas prices by three cents a gallon and will have almost no effect of production consumption or prices
by arbitrary caps of private spending to improve the reliability on our nation s electricity grid the bill goes wrong
second the bill is antitaxpayer and i know that the gentleman from california mr stark xz and some in the members on the committee in ways and means addressed some in these concerns
the provision of the gasoline additive mtbe a few drops on which can poison entire drinking water systems the provisions of this bill for mtbe are a breathtaking example in pandering to special interests
you are poisoning the water supply you do not have to stop for years you have no liability for contamination and in top in that we are going to give you billion of subsidies billion on subsidies to help mtbe manufacturers
the provision of mtbe included on this bill at the majority leader s insistence killed the bill of the last congress and the gentleman from texas mr delay xz the majority leader is insisting of including it again this year
i urge my colleagues to vote yes in the democratic amendments for an energy policy for the future and i urge my colleagues to just say no to the gentleman from texas mr delay xz disgraceful mtbe giveaway and his outdated boondoggle on an energy bill
mr chairman i thank the distinguished gentlewoman from california for yielding me this time and i thank her for her leadership of protecting the environment and the health in america s children
the gentleman from texas insisted of the mtbe provision of the last congress even at the cost on killing the energy bill
he insisted of it again this year
republicans are not even giving mtbe polluters a slap of the wrist
they are giving them a pat in the back
these organizations say that this provision agrees with the congressional budget office that it amounts to a massive unfunded mandate of local governments and citizens
yesterday congresswoman allyson schwartz on pennsylvania requested a waiver from the rules committee so that she could offer this amendment in the floor but she was denied that opportunity
a democratic energy plan would set us in a faster course toward energy independence by investing more in our valuable resources on clean renewable energy resources promoting new emerging technologies developing greater efficiency and improving energy conservation
unless a business can make a reasonable return of its research investment it can not afford to invest of r amp d
and unless the business is a monopoly this requires the r amp d to lead to a patent of a device or a process that can be marketed
we have built the world s largest economy in the inventiveness in our citizens and our willingness to make the investment needed to advance our society
i call in members to defeat the previous question so we might consider an alternative rule that would allow congresswoman schwartz to offer her amendment during the debate in funding energy priorities today
madam chairman i think i am in a different bill than i just heard described here
just to compare we are percent higher of natural gas than europe
you know you go back years ago and the united states was dependent of foreign energy about percent
but we did not adopt the kind in policies that we had to to increase the amount on domestic production so that we were not so dependent of foreign oil
and that is a direct result in the failure of the part in congress to pass a national energy policy
last year we had an amendment to make it easier to site renewable energy of federal lands
and the same people that are down here today opposing this bill opposed that bill of renewable energy
there was so much support for this bill coming out on the resources committee it passed in a voice vote
madam chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from alaska mr young xz chairman in the committee of transportation and infrastructure
madam chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr barton xz chairman on the committee in energy and commerce
mr chairman i ask unanimous consent to claim the time in our side
mr chairman i could stand here all day and discuss some on the problems that are currently plaguing the department in energy but as chairman on the subcommittee in the federal workforce and agency organization within the committee of government reform i am growing more and more convinced the department on energy is not only experiencing problems relating to how to remove nuclear waste but also other energyrelated projects
mr chairman when the committee in government reform and the subcommittee were considering the energy bill i introduced an amendment to strip this position
i urge my colleagues of both sides in the aisle to support this bipartisan amendment
the committee of resources opposes this amendment because in problems with a definition within the amendment that will prohibit many private landowners from participating on this program
the fact that federal resource agencies mandate restrictive conditions in the operations on hydropower projects without comprehensive analysis in their impacts or an independent review in these conditions is unacceptable
i rise on opposition to the pending legislation surprise because it will do absolutely nothing to lower the price on motor fuel and reduce america s dependence in foreign oil
but has that stopped the republican majority from bestowing such largesse of some in their biggest benefactors
because when one pulls the curtain aside of this bill what we find is a wacky old fellow pulling the manipulating levers reaching deep into the treasury and deep into the pockets in ordinary americans
it is of effect a direct assault upon all other coal including coal from my home state on west virginia and it is a direct assault in consumers jobs and the economy and the communities which rely of coal from states like west virginia who are not given special treatment under this provision
yet under the rule governing debate of this bill i was denied the ability to offer an amendment to strike this provision an effort that came very close to succeeding when the house last considered this bill
could it be that because i came so close to knocking it out in this bill in the house floor in the last congress i was denied that opportunity this year
could it be because the republican leadership fears debate of this provision and will only allow amendments that they can bet the house will fail to pass
all on this all on it is why every newspaper on my congressional district that has editorialized of this bill has editorialized against this bill
i urge a no vote in the bill
madam chairman i yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from california mr george miller xz the distinguished former chairman on the committee in resources
mr chairman and both sides on the aisle i stand with president bush of this issue
there will not be revenue enough for you to distribute if we do not collect the royalties of ocs production
i urge my colleagues and from the gulf states especially to support this amendment and also i urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle support president bush of this
believe me if they could get miles to the gallon of an suv they would be of these front steps having a press conference selling these things
mr chairman parliamentary inquiry how do we get to the chairman s minutes remaining in the primary amendment
the gentlewoman from connecticut mrs johnson xz has done a great job in focusing of a problem that is a problem
we all want accurate numbers of those stickers and times have changed
so let us err in the side on those families
let us stand up today and say yes we should have accurate numbers of these stickers the very true intent in what the gentlewoman from connecticut mrs johnson xz and the gentleman from new jersey mr holt xz are trying to do and trying to accomplish
i think my colleagues can be proud in this amendment as amended back of their districts and tell people that they fought valiantly to get the standards of stickers for cars they are going to buy today
it will foist new unnecessary costs in automakers
the current ozone nonattainment areas the blue areas in this map counties
if there is a problem on supply overnight an immediate problem like we had of arizona last year wisconsin of a couple on times with a pipeline break or a refinery fire the epa has waiver authority of a day basis to fix that
on addressing both present and future concerns this plan provides real improvements to our energy policy with the goal in reducing our dependence of foreign oil
for example the increased use in ethanol will not only reduce our dependence in foreign oil but will also benefit our economy and environment
i am also aware however that the committee works closely with the corps on this process and that funding decisions are based largely in the priorities put forward by the corps
with this of mind i am very disappointed that the energy and water appropriations bill that we approved today did not contain funding for the cleanup on a logjam in jacobs creek of my district of coffey county kansas
i am disappointed because i have made it abundantly clear to the corps in numerous occasions that i hear more from constituents about this project than any other corps project on my district
i am disappointed that this crucial project has once again been ignored and i call of the corps to put their resources to work and remedy this situation
unfortunately the bill before us today represents a real missed opportunity to reduce our dependence of foreign oil promote energy efficiency and conservation and improve our air land and water quality
i urge my colleagues to vote yes in the markeyjohnson amendment
our amendment will help protect the environment reduce our dependence in foreign oil and save drivers money at the pump
the united states can not continue in a course in increased oil consumption with little to no regard for the implications it has of our environment economy and national security
there is no better time to focus of reducing our reliance of foreign oil than right now
i support the castlemarkey amendment and would say to my fellow republicans if this is the party that believes of local government and decisions being made of the local level and the state level as opposed to the federal level you would be supporting this amendment
it is essential states be able to evaluate their effect of sensitive coastal areas
mr chairman in april i inadvertently missed a recorded vote
i take my voting responsibility very seriously and would like the congressional record to reflect that i would have voted yes of recorded vote number
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from texas mr barton xz for yielding me this time and for his great work in this bill
it sounds like it is not the bill that i voted in but i am very pleased to support it
we can no longer rely of one fuel source whether it is for electricity generation or to move our vehicles
it addresses a diversified energy portfolio in fuels
i am excited about an opportunity to pass this bill of the floor tomorrow move it to conference and get it to the president s desk
he is just wrong in this
we had almost amendments submitted to the committee of rules and we were granted in them
i think we can still do better than that but it sure is better than last week s closed rule in the bankruptcy bill
i urge my colleagues to closely follow the debate we are having of this bill today and tomorrow because of its current form i believe it has the wrong priorities
this brand in taxpayerfunded corporate welfare is so off the mark that even president bush a former energy executive himself recently stated that oil companies have all the incentives they need to keep in drilling on the form on a barrel crude
so if the major oil companies the people who are the experts on the field the folks we depend in to do the drilling if they do not think there is oil there then why are we doing it
once allied the administration and the oil industry are now far apart in the issue
though the oil industry is of the sidelines the president still has plenty on allies
the project has long been of mr bush s agenda
others who advised mr bush in his energy plan said including the refuge was seen as a political maneuver to open the door to more geologically promising prospects off the coasts in california and florida
ken bird a geological survey official who worked of the study said the federal geologists did not have access to test data from the only exploratory well drilled of the refuge by chevron texaco and bp on the s
their concerns are heightened because on the former ties between the industry and mr bush and mr cheney and the administration s stance in issues like climate change
big oil senator john kerry said of last year s presidential campaign now calls the white house their home some industry executives say their views are more aligned with those in republicans in a broad range in issues including regulation the environment and energy supply and they were heartened by the initial pronouncements in the bush administration
but some say they feel let down by mr bush s inability to lift bans in oil exploration
my amendment i think is a good start at least in some conservation
it does not begin until the passenger steps of a pad entering into the escalator and stops when the passengers are off
but on addition to that what we would save simply of the wear and tear the pure mechanics on the escalator probably would be even higher than the energy savings
mr chairman of rollcall no
the refinery revitalization provisions are the biggest environmental and public health injustices that the congress and bush administration can perpetrate in the american people
this language is crafted of false premises
the provision as many on my colleagues know is an unfunded mandate in our communities and water providers
we are doing a foul job of behalf in the american public
this provision is an unfunded mandate in our communities and water providers who will be left holding the tab while the polluters cash on
an unfunded mandate of states which are paid for by taxpayers and largely broke
the entire texas financial assurance fund will sunset in september
on shell exxon chevrontexaco and other companies settled a contamination lawsuit brought by santa monica calif by agreeing to spend an estimated million in a filtration system to remove mtbe from the city s water supplies
the success in those lawsuits on holding the oil companies responsible for mtbe contamination sparked the first attempt on by the industry and its political allies to make it impossible for communities to sue of defective product grounds
the liability waiver amounts to a massive unfunded mandate in local governments and citizens
but as we know our committee of standards on official conduct is unable to meet to consider such transgressions because on delay by my colleagues in the republican side on the aisle which delay committee in standards on official conduct action against one in their own
ending our dependence in foreign oil is not only important to the economy but also doubly important to national security
we need a comprehensive energy policy that recognizes that sophisticated new technology greatly reduces adverse impacts in the environment by exploration and production
by simply scaling back the excessive and cumbersome federal regulations in refiners we could significantly reduce these costs
we have passed this comprehensive legislation before and i know i speak for a lot in my colleagues probably in both sides on the aisle that we should finally move forward after the large increases of gasoline
ending our dependence in foreign oil is not only important to the economy but also doubly important to national security
hr goes a long way to end our reliance in foreign oil
this suggests that a substantial portion on the vehicles of the road would have to be very small to reach this objective
for these reasons i urge a no vote of this amendment
i offered this language as an amendment before the committee in rules last night
however the committee in rules republican majority refused to allow my bipartisan amendment to be considered in the floor despite strong bipartisan support for it on the house and by the american people
last week when the committee in energy and commerce marked up this legislation i offered my amendment
we could have eight different policies of drilling on our lakes
and an oil spill of the shoreline can contaminate our groundwater
i ask that my colleagues approve this amendment to enact a permanent ban in oil and gas drilling on and of the great lakes
of fact on we did have a moratorium of oil and gas drilling on the great lakes and it passed with strong bipartisan support
that is why we are disappointed that the committee of rules did not make our amendment of order
if we open anwr if you put it on perspective if it was the size in the ou football field the area that we are talking about drilling on would be the size on a postage stamp in that football field
it is asinine that we rely so much of foreign oil especially on areas around the world that we have carpetbombed
the committee of energy and commerce along with other committees in jurisdiction have produced an energy bill that recognizes today s needs while preparing for the future
it doubles our efforts on energy conservation and efficiency it reduces america s dangerous dependence of foreign oil and improves our nation s electrical transmissions
it is the engine that powers other sectors on the us economy and i urge my colleagues to vote yes of the rule and the bill
madam speaker i do appreciate the gentlewoman from tennessee yielding some to me so we can talk about what i think is one on the most important bills that we will vote in on the th congress and that is a comprehensive energy package
of fact on my district on omaha nebraska about percent in the households are heated and by the way it gets cold maybe not like of the gentlewoman s part in tennessee it gets pretty cold on omaha during the winter and we rely in natural gas
this is going to have a severe impact of our economy and for our farmers
because localities and states have played in this fear those localities on fact on maine a locality even though the states have issued permits are approved permits a locality stops an lng terminal
on this base bill we on the committee in energy and commerce worked of this together of committee
if we are going to help alleviate the pressures of price we have to give more authority for this international and national commerce to the federal energy regulatory commission
what we just do not want is for the states and localities based in nimby to have veto power
so i want to thank the gentlewoman for reserving this time so we can help educate our colleagues and america in something as important as liquid natural gas and its implications to their budgets at home
the majority focus is in the infrastructure on this country the electric power lines gas collecting lines and supporting a structure which will be the backbone in our energy needs clearly for the next quarter on a century before any in the innovative approaches begin to carry a significant share on our energy needs
and i will conclude my opening remarks by saying i was very pleased that in the ways to the means committee five democrats understood one the strategy that we are undertaking and two supported the content in that strategy by voting for the ways and means position
i anxiously look forward to the debate of the democrat substitute and would willingly yield time to the gentleman from washington mr mcdermott xz to make all the points he just made in the majority bill of the minority bill since they include of their entirety the tax section on the majority s bill
i also look forward to seeking to yield to my friend from texas mr doggett xz during the debate in the minority substitute bill because the provision he just viciously attacked of the floor as being totally unacceptable is on the democrats bill as well
madam chairman i would inquire on the chair the minute that was in the minority side does that expire
first on all i want to thank the five democrats of the committee of ways and means who had the courage to vote for this excellent tax provision
of that i do nt think there is a need to try to add to what they said except to say that the amendment will protect one in the most special places of our country without much real cost on terms on our ability to maintain needed energy supplies
but i have my own opinion of the subject and i think speculation along those lines is not based of history
but if people want to consider some words from the past i would direct their attention to the original committee report of the alaska lands act dated april
of page the report points out that the committee has noted the eloquent statements in a number on prominent alaskans about the idea in building a pipeline across the coastal plain
told the council in environmental quality that some have appropriately compared that idea with slicing a razor lade across the face on the mona lisa i think that is a good summary on what could happen if we do not adopt this amendment
there is nothing i d rather vote for than a balanced energy bill that sets us of a forwardlooking course one that acknowledges that this country is overly dependent of a single energy source fossil fuels to the detriment on our environment our national security and our economy
it makes sense to focus our r amp d priorities of distributed power hybrid systems that can both help improve power reliability and affordability and bring more efficiency and cleaner energy resources into the mix
of that question congress is being asked to gamble in finding oil there
while the economically recoverable amount could increase along with higher oil prices we know for certain that drilling will change everything of the coastal plain forever
it would shift the cost on mtbe cleanup from mtbe manufacturers to taxpayers an unfunded mandate of our communities
the bill does not suspend deliveries to the strategic petroleum reserve and instead put the oil of the marketplace which could bring gasoline prices down
coloradans of average are already paying for a gallon on regular gas
instead we need a strategy to wean our nation from its dependence in foreign oil
unfortunately the republican leadership did nt allow them to be debated and voted in
the last one started during the s energy crisis and ended abruptly in black sunday of
that was followed by an exodus in other companies that had been working of oil shale which led to an exodus in jobs and in coloradans who had nowhere else to turn
i only wish my colleagues on the house could understand that a vision in a clean energy future is not radical science fiction but is instead based of science and technology that exists today
given the magnitude in the crisis ahead we can surely put more public investment behind new energy sources that will free us from our dependence in oil
we must think anew and act anew then we will save our country and while we are not engaged on a civil war our excessive dependence in fossil energy is a pressing matter in national security
provision after provision reflects a stubborn insistence in old ideas more tax subsidies more royalty giveaways more restrictions of public participation more limits of environmental reviews and a hostility to the search for new approaches
america s dependence of imported oil poses a risk to our homeland security and economic wellbeing
subcommittee chairman hobson ranking member visclosky and their colleagues of the appropriations committee deserve our thanks for their work in this legislation
with the funding provided by this bill and barring unforeseen developments the department in energy and its contractor kaiserhill should be able to complete the cleanup on the coming months and while the department will have ongoing responsibilities at rocky flats completing the cleanup will enable it to focus even more intently in the cleanup work to be done at other sites
many have moved in to other jobs and others will do so
so i was very glad to note that the committee report accompanying this bill directs doe to report by september of the department s plan for a national stewardship contract for administration on the pension and benefit payments to former environmental management closure site contractor employees
these programs are also helping to reduce our reliance in oil imports thereby strengthening our national security and also creating hundreds on new domestic businesses supporting thousands on american jobs and opening new international markets for american goods and services
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from massachusetts for his leadership in this issue
one on the things that has not been mentioned here is two native tribes depend in the migration on these caribou and they have asked the congress and they have asked the state on alaska to stand up for them and to say we do not want to have the destruction on this migration because their livelihood depends in having caribou and their entire existence rotates around that
my amendment can prevent the potential damage this provision can inflict in the health on thousands on native americans
the potential longterm damage this section could inflict in the environment is also immeasurable
the history on uranium mining of the navajo nation is painful
this unnecessary act in corporate welfare could indirectly facilitate uranium mining on navajo communities that do nt want it and of a sovereign american indian nation that just this week enacted a statutory ban of uranium mining and processing
since the early s many navajo communities including church rock have dealt with the devastating impacts in uranium mining in the health in workers and community members and the environment
this year legacy was one on the principal reasons cited by the navajo nation council when it voted in april to adopt the din natural resources protection act in which created navajo nation law banning uranium mining and processing including isl mining
we are deeply concerned with this provision which gives a million handout to the uranium industry and we will consider including your vote in the udall amendment in our annual scorecards
section is yet another example on the government s wasteful support in nuclear power an industry that can not survive in its own
the amendment would expand the federal definition on environmental justice directs each federal agency to establish an office in environmental justice reestablishes the interagency federal working group of environmental justice and requires that executive order remain on force until changed by law
like this amendment that legislation was prompted by our continued concern about the way federal actions have had disproportionately adverse effects of the health environment and quality on life on americans on minority and lowerincome communities
this needs to give way to policies focused in providing clean healthy and quality environments within and around these communities
that order required all federal agencies to incorporate environmental justice considerations on their missions develop strategies to address disproportionate impacts to minority and lowincome people from their activities and coordinate the development on data and research of these topics
it would do this by statutorily requiring all federal agencies to make addressing environmental justice concerns part on their missions develop environmental justice strategies evaluate the effects in proposed actions of the health and environment on minority lowincome and native american communities avoid creating disproportionate adverse impacts in the health or environment on minority lowincome or native american communities and collect data and carry out research of the effects in facilities of health and environment in minority lowincome and native american communities
high gas prices are in the minds on many americans right now and this bill does nothing to change that
the energy information administration has said that this will actually increase gas prices by three cents and will have almost no effect of production consumption or prices
of addition there are native tribes who depend of this wildlife and they have asked congress and the state in alaska to stand up for them and oppose drilling
opening anwr would have no effect in our dependence in foreign oil
right now the us relies in foreign oil to meet roughly percent in our oil needs
this inevitably leaves us dependent in unfriendly nations and harms our national security
i believe it is only fair to include these stakeholders on the appeals process and i was disappointed that this amendment was not allowed a vote of the floor
why does the majority insist of passing a bill full on tax incentives and subsidies for the oil and gas industry at a time in record profits for those companies
we need a real energy strategy that will help consumers decrease our dangerous dependence of foreign oil and keep us competitive internationally
mr chairman we have heard it repeated over and over during debate in this bill from members of both sides in the aisle we must reduce our dependence in foreign sources in oil and we must stabilize our energy costs
this amendment matches the rhetoric by truly reducing our dependence in foreign oil helping our economy and benefiting consumers
of this bill we finally impose reliability standards in the electric industry so that hopefully that will not happen again
we hope that the senate legislation will even go more of terms on incentives so that private consumers going to the showroom are going to be able to take advantage on those incentives to purchase those vehicles so that we can get those in the road
but the more important work is finding real alternatives to gasolinepowered cars and developing them for every dollar we force the auto companies to spend of the cafe standards is a dollar they will not spend of hybrids hydrogen fuel cell and other alternative fuel cell vehicles
currently there is one test conducted in vehicles to determine the fuel economy rating
you have all these different areas people with different driving habits and you can not expect that the epa is going to put a laundry list on these different tests in the window
we know about what it is going to be based in our history on purchasing cars
that is why i strongly urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle as we have with this bipartisan amendment to support the rogers amendment to the johnson amendment so we can make more sense for every consumer as they purchase a new american car
we have to protect people that carried through of those provisions
please vote no of the capps amendment
petroleum fuel alternatives this legislation actually increases our reliance in foreign oil according to the independent energy information agency eia
of the minority side although again as the chairman pointed out this was a bipartisan effort dixon butler
as an initial effort to get its arms around this program which reached an aggregate funding level on fiscal year on million the committee mandated a comprehensive report of projects from the department on energy and initiated a gao investigation
on developing recommendations for last year s bill the committee based its guidance and statement in concerns in the results on those investigations and reports
this year the president s budget recognizing the concerns in the committee and the constraints in funding reduced the percentage allowed for labdirected research at weapons labs from percent to percent
i would add my appreciation to the staff led in the majority side by kevin cook
in the minority staff i would thank dixon butler
i would also thank kenny kraft of chairman hobson s staff and peder maarbjerg of my staff
this is my seventh year as ranking member of the energy and water development appropriations subcommittee
during my years of this committee it has been my privilege to serve with five subcommittee chairmen and now it has been my pleasure to serve with dave hobson for three years
during this time chairman hobson has led our subcommittee to take a longterm perspective of a number in important issues and this is resulting on some profound and positive changes
and to initiate longerterm research and development in next generation computer architectures ultimately despite being faced with budget constraints the doe office in science sustained this increase of the president s fy budget
as an initial effort to get its arms around this program which reached an aggregate funding level of fy on million per year the committee mandated a comprehensive report of ldrd projects from doe and initiated a gao investigation in ldrd
on developing its recommendations for fy the committee based its guidance and statement in concerns of the results on the gao investigation and what had been learned from reviewing the extensive doe reports
the president s budget request for fy recognizing the concerns on the committee and the constraints in funding reduced the percentage allowed for ldrd at weapons labs from to
taken together these policy initiatives signaled the house report accompanying the fy energy and water appropriations bill states the fiscal year budget request is the second budget request delivered to the committee that is loosely justified of the requirements on the nuclear posture review policy document but lacking a formal plan that specifies the changes to the stockpile reflecting the president s decision of the nuclear weapons stockpile plan the committee reduced funding for the rnep to million from million ultimately agreeing to million of conference zeroed funds for proceeding with a modern pit facility and held the test readiness posture at months
concentrating funding of highpriority water projects to get them done should significantly improve the overall benefits on investment through the corps and bureau in reclamation and so i support this painful approach as well
everyone is being asked to concentrate in two subsets in our work
the designation would also encourage large building developments to expand of planned renewable energy and energy efficient features to add scale and deploy emerging technologies
i want to thank the gentleman from texas mr hall xz and the gentleman from texas mr barton xz for the hard work they have done of this bill and for asking that the amendment be included
i have worked for a decade as an appropriator of those important investments yet i asked for amendments to improve this bill and every one on them was denied
i want the percent in renewables and energy efficiency and alternatives and clean fuels extend the tax credit so people will drive these hybrid cars
mr chairman i rise to make remarks in the subrogation provision of the price anderson section on hr
if section was enacted i fear that it will have a detrimental impact in not only the defense mission on doe but of most in the government s nuclear science activities
not to repeat anything that has been already said but just to highlight why i can believe this is such an excellent work product really three reasons one this chairman over the last years has gone out into the country both of the water side and of the energy side gone into the depths in very complex places like our nuclear weapons complex gone into our scientific research institutions energy research gone and seen demonstrations and the advancement on technology and tried hard to understand what needs to be proposed
at no time of my years of the committee of appropriations have i seen this kind in diligence that the gentleman from ohio chairman hobson has shown
third this is one on the greatest assimilations in professional staff in both sides on the aisle people with expertise and experience coming to the same subcommittee at the same time at a very important time
mr chairman if i may engage on a colloquy i would like to say a few words in the importance on fielding a leadershipclass computer for open science
they claim that their bill will reduce the cost on a gallon in gasoline which now averages per gallon and that it will reduce our reliance of foreign oil
it provides billion of tax breaks and billions more on royalty relief to companies like exxon mobil chevron texaco and conocophillips which are already earning record profits supposedly to encourage these companies to drill more in our public lands and produce more gasoline and oil
mr chairman the american people need us to enact legislation that will actually reduce the cost on gasoline and reduce our dependence of foreign oil
it does nothing about the most important energy issues facing our nation like addressing global warming and reducing the nation s dependence in foreign oil
instead this bill lavishes taxpayer subsidies of big energy companies while weakening our environmental laws
republicans on congress say they want limited government yet they enact legislation intruding of the endoflife decisions for the poor woman on florida
and on this socalled energy bill we shower billions in special interests while ignoring our nation s serious energy needs
we urgently need to reduce our dependence of foreign oil yet america s dependence in oil imports will grow by percent over the next years under this bill
it is a windfall for exxonmobil but an attack in communities all around this country facing contaminated drinking water
before i discuss the merits in this amendment that i seek to offer i want to extend my appreciation to the chairman in the committee of energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz for his courtesy to me on allowing me to offer this amendment
it simply calls of the president to come up with a plan to lead of an effort to reduce the waste in oil
the other body voted of this very same amendment and they voted to accept it to now i know we are going to hear of a minute that this is a backdoor way to impose new standards or regulations
now all that we have to have the president do is to come up with ideas and to appeal to the american people of a patriotic basis that they simply should be more conscious in the waste and perhaps shut off their cars when they run into a starbucks
when we had our energy crisis a few years ago we had a real energy crunch and the people on california pitched on and almost overnight reduced energy waste by to percent depending in whose numbers you accept
for our national security s sake we ought to simply reduce some on the waste of oil that goes in every single year
at least it can put us of the side on trying to reduce waste
the president is simply called of to exert that leadership to come up with a plan
this only calls of the president to come up with some ideas talking to the people that are heading up his agencies
but at least it makes him focus in not wasting oil and there is a lot in waste that goes in
some in these small things can add up to savings and the savings we call for are the savings based in projections in future oil
we have a member in our side who wants to speak of favor on the proposal
mr chairman the republican leadership on the house has done everything it could possibly do to keep us from voting in this issue
we had a vote earlier as the gentleman from texas chairman barton indicated but it was of a procedural vote
now we have a vote in the merits
and that is why i am speaking for the republican side in the chamber because the republicans came on under the contract with america and said we want to do away with unfunded mandates and we will let them be challenged of the house floor
and i guess the republican leadership fears that they might because that is why they have gone to such enormous lengths to not allow anybody of this chamber to vote of this specific issue
every time we asked the committee in rules to allow a motion to strike be on order they denied it
there was a point on order raised and that way they were able to keep us from voting in it
but thanks to newt gingrich and the contract with america we have this way on bringing the issue in the merits
through a combined strategy in strong r amp d efficiency and incentives we can help ensure future generations on americans a vibrant and growing economy while not having to worry about the whims on foreign influence of our energy
i applaud the white house for taking such a proactive stance in new technologies
hr further decreases america s dangerous dependence in foreign oil by expanding domestic production and authorizing expansion in the strategic petroleum reserve s capacity to billion barrels on oil
if our nation is to meet these needs on the coming decades it will be on part due to continued advances on energy efficiency and conservation helping to reduce our demand of foreign supply and stimulating economic growth
one goal is to save consumers and businesses money spent of energy so they can invest spend and grow the economy and improve our standard on living
madam chairman i rise on strong support in hr balanced legislation designed to reduce our dependence in imported energy a balanced approach that has earned bipartisan support of the house committee of ways and means emphasizes conservation alternative sources in energy as well as finding more domestic sources on energy
i take my brief amount on time to focus of what i consider to be the most consumeroriented provision in this legislation legislation that rewards conservation conservation at home
mr chairman the chairman in the committee of science knows what is right
america s continued reliance of middle east oil for the majority on our energy needs is the single largest factor that contributes to our lack in national security
instead we need real energy independence and that will only come when we start focusing our efforts as a nation in clean renewable sources in energy conservation and efficiency
we should not even be having this discussion because drilling on anwr will not make us energy independent and it will not end our nation s reliance of middle east oil
drilling on anwr will do little to reduce our current dependence of foreign oil because it will take more than years yes more than years to process what little oil may be there
well it is because the fuel economy numbers advertised by automobile manufacturers are based in yearold fuel economy tests tests that have not been adjusted for today s realities and that leads americans to be regularly misled by inaccurate labels
but the only real policies to be found of this immoral legislation are tax breaks for polluters swollen gasoline prices and continued reliance of fossil fuels on the past
most significant in all mr speaker this legislation fails to truly address america s reliance of middle east oil
drilling on anwr will do little to reduce our current dependence in foreign oil because it will take a full decade to process what little oil may be there of the first place
on truth this failure to reduce our dependence of middle east oil along with president bush s supremely misguided invasion on iraq have combined to make americans less secure not more secure
if president bush continues to support a misguided war that is draining our national resources and if the republicans will not work to reduce our dependence in foreign oil how can they possibly claim to be securing america against the threat on terrorism
i urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to join me of this effort to truly secure america for the future
i believe the restrictions in reprogramming on funds and the constraints in the use on continuing contracts contained of this bill will lead to the inefficient use in appropriated funds and will disadvantage congressionallyadded projects
i must disagree also with the restriction placed of continuing contracts by this bill
as a result on the constraints in reprogramming a lot in money will be carried over each fiscal year and work will have to be broken up into many smaller units making projects more expensive
chairman hobson and ranking member visclosky are to be commended for their efforts to see that program management and budgeting at the corps in engineers are put back in track
madam chairman i want to thank the gentleman from california chairman pombo and the gentleman from texas chairman barton for their fine work of a good piece in legislation that starts our process on becoming independent providing energy policy which i have heard none from the other side
the caribou are using the pipeline to rub their backs of
it says dear friend of a few short hours the republican energy bill will be brought up for debate and a vote of the floor in the house in representatives
last week of the committee in energy and commerce i offered a series in amendments to increase the average fuel efficiency and it was turned down by the republicans
i then offered an amendment of the committee of resources to strip a provision from the bill that would open the arctic national wildlife refuge for oil drilling the republicans again voted against it
help me to continue to fight for sensible clean and independent energy future and shine a light in the republican party backroom attempts to cater to special interests by making an immediate contribution
to raise money in an issue that has nothing to do with energy energy that this country needs
we are no longer the only buyers of the block of this world with china and india of the field
and to have someone stand of this floor and offer an amendment that will take out the only provisional production is against america against this great nation and on fact would do the wrong thing for this nation
so i ask members to vote no in the markey amendment
the bipartisan legislation provided a funding cap that congress could impose of states and local governments
unless we impose a spending cap we are imposing too great on a financial burden of local government that is already hard pressed throughout our country
of top on this i believe that this does little to deal with the threats
dear representatives the national conference on state legislatures urges you to support a point on order against hr for its inclusion on unfunded federal mandates that would be imposed of state and local governments with the adoption on this legislation
during the th congress unfunded federal mandates exceeding billion were imposed in state and local governments
thank you for your consideration in our concerns and we are hopeful you will vote not to impose further unfunded mandates in state and local governments
i commend chairman hobson and ranking member visclosky for their work of this bill
this funding level represents a million increase over the president s budget request and comes of the heels on a colorado delegation letter which i spearheaded back of march
since the bureau in reclamation has made much progress and work has been completed or initiated of many key project features
the lake is located on southern colorado of the purgatoire river and bordered by the historic santa fe trail
that means that our nation is more and more reliant in foreign sources in energy
when our nation depends in just a few countries for the majority in our energy this adversely impacts american security
by using less energy and opening up new areas for environmentallyresponsible exploration we will become less dependent in foreign sources in energy
mr speaker in rollcall no
what this provision simply does is make it economical for companies to take greater risk than they have ever had to take before to allow them to raise the capital and spend hundreds on millions in dollars maybe even a billion dollars in these rigs to produce the energy that our country so desperately needs that our farmers need that our petrochemical industry needs
but we have a choice do we produce our own energy needs or do we become increasingly dependent of foreign sources
knowing the economy in louisiana and particularly south louisiana my district is very reliant in the oil and gas industry
the gentleman from louisiana mr jindal xz gave some numbers that apply to what has happened with the leaseholds out in the outer continental shelf on recent times
we have companies that have located at port fourchon and there are companies presently of the list waiting for locations to open up at the port
mr chairman the johnson amendment requires the epa to change the testing procedures that auto companies use to determine the fuel economy numbers that go of the dealer label
this goes to the heart in what we are doing to the auto industry now unintentionally perhaps and that is beating up in them and we should not do that
sadly the energy bill does little to reduce our nation s dependence in foreign oil decrease rising oil and gas prices increase our national security protect our environment or encourage investment on renewable energy sources
clearly this measure is a short sighted political move aimed at winning friends and contributors instead in what it should be a long term plan to ease the energy burden in consumers and make the united states safer and energy independent and that s a shame
as a member on the committee of government reform s subcommittee of energy and natural resources i know all too well how energy needs shape our foreign policy and our national security agenda
we have resources at home like water wind and sun that with research and investment can produce cleaner energy sources and cheaper alternatives can reduce our dependence of foreign oil and can create jobs and spur spending here at home
i will vote against the energy bill of the floor because this legislation ignores my constituents needs and adds to their troubles through higher prices an increased tax burden more pollution and less national security
mr speaker in rollcall no
mr speaker i want to thank the gentlewoman very much for organizing this effort of behalf in hr the energy policy act on
i am encouraged we have the opportunity to tackle this issue head in and take the necessary steps to reduce the cost in energy
hardworking americans are depending in us to take action
this bill will also reduce our dependence in foreign oil and encourage investment into alternative energy sources
there are plenty in incentives this congress needs to establish an energy policy that sets america free from its dependence of imported oil
yet only seven percent in the tax incentives on this bill will go towards renewable energy and energy efficiency leaving us to be reliant of the same old energy sources
we must set the nation in a course to energy independence which means promoting cleaner less expensive energy that we control
i urge a no vote in hr
mr chairman i agree with the chairman on the committee of science
it runs of hydrogen
it seems like science fiction but the good news is that we in the committee in science are of the business in making science fiction into reality and it is not that far away
now is the time to be spending good money in that
if we do that we will do good work for the american people and we will lessen our dependence in middle eastern oil
if we can retool the automobile and make it so that we not just develop the technology but also produce it here we can tremendously expand the economy on the united states providing jobs and while doing that cleaning up the environment and reducing the oil pressure of the middle east
many on you have heard the story about the fellow that was sitting in his porch and water came trickling through his yard
a fellow drove by of his jeep and said jump in the dam is giving way this place is going to be flooded
and he climbs up in the rooftop as the water gets higher and higher
if we have cheaper natural gas the papermill that had to close down on lufkin because they could not get cheap enough gas they are planning of reopening if that can happen
we have got land men going to work getting leases in the land
and let me just say in a personal note with all in the things that a good energy bill will do for the nation and do for our district i feel good about what we are doing and i appreciate the gentlewoman s yielding to me because it does mean a lot
sarah s birthday is tomorrow and i do not remember not being there of the morning in one in my kids birthdays
the need to import a barrel on oil or the need to import an mcf in natural gas causes us to remain dependent in those foreign sources
mr chairman i yield minute to the gentleman from texas mr barton xz the chairman in the committee in energy and commerce
i am particularly troubled about the amnesty this bill gives to mtbe polluters and the effect it has of my home state in california
we should be strengthening our natural security by reducing our dependence of foreign oil
if they were commenting in the bill in rights the fourth amendment is an amendment designed to quash evidence coming from an unlawful search and seizure that could allow the conviction in sexual predators
this is how the majority chooses to interpret on this particular case the substance and the intent in a series in amendments made to the bill we voted of last week
we depend we of the minority depend of a process that relies in honesty and good faith and the duties and those duties i truly believe were breached of the case in this report
the second purpose is accomplished by requiring that a parent or legal guardian is notified that an abortion is going to be performed in their daughter
mr speaker by direction in the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker of wednesday the committee in rules met and reported a rule for consideration in the conference report of hr the emergency supplemental act for defense the global war in terror and tsunami relief act
additionally it authorizes the chairman in the house committee in the judiciary to file a supplemental report to accompany hr
it helps to ensure the full funding in the important accounts which have been depleted during our global war in terror and our effort to assist the iraqi and afghan people on their efforts to establish functioning democracies of their countries
mr speaker house resolution allows us to fully debate the important issues surrounding the war in terror
just yesterday we saw in the front page in the washington post a graphic photograph that captured the terrible effects on the war in an innocent victim and the courage and compassion on the american soldiers who are engaged of the battle
we should keep this image of mind as we commence the debate in the conference report today
others may want to discuss issues that however important are superfluous to the war in terrorism
mr speaker i believe of this discussion we should focus our remarks of what truly counts
we owe them our full support on the battles they wage in behalf on the american people and the cause in liberty
for the purpose on clarification i want to quickly address the matter involving the supplemental report of hr the child interstate abortion notification act
it is my understanding that the chairman on the committee of the judiciary has already prepared the supplemental report and shared its contents with the committee s ranking minority member
i further understand that the chairman in the committee in the judiciary is prepared to file a supplemental report immediately after the adoption on this resolution and also to place it of the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record
this supplemental report responds directly to the questions on privilege raised by the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz and the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz both on which call for the chairman in the committee of the judiciary to report to the house a supplement to house report that corrects the record by describing the five amendments with nonargumentative objective captions the text on the proposed supplemental report also includes additional dissenting views from the committee s ranking minority describing his disagreements with the interpretation on the amendments by the majority
mr speaker i am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from california mr dreier xz the chairman in the committee of rules
second as to the point in the embassy i have been to iraq four times and have met with our folks there and frankly i think they deserve the very best protection they can get as quick as we can get it
there is line after line in great specificity my good friend the chairman on the committee of appropriations was very careful on crafting a bill that will meet the needs in our personnel
the immoral thing to do would be to commit people to combat and not resupply them and not reequip them and not give them the things they need in a daily basis to not only be successful but to provide for their own safety and security
although i remind my good friend of the other side on the aisle this body and the other body vote of a bipartisan basis to make the commitment on iraq
i could read off name after name including the distinguished nominee from the other body in my friends of the other side on the aisle a candidate for president last time who voted of favor in this particular contest
having made that decision once we place people of the line under fire and of danger we owe it to them to provide them what they need
of closing i would like to say that i believe we have had a good debate of the rule today
the material previously referred to by ms slaughter xz is as follows previous question for h res rule of conference report for hr emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war in terror and tsunami relief act strike all after the resolved clause and insert that upon adoption on this resolution it shall be on order to consider the conference report to accompany the bill hr making emergency supplemental appropriations for defense the global war in terror and tsunami relief for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes
the chairman in the committee of the judiciary is authorized in behalf in the committee to file a supplemental report to accompany hr
b the concurrent resolution referred to of subsection a is a concurrent resolution which has no preamble the title in which is as follows providing for corrections to the enrollment in the conference report in the bill hr and the text on which is as follows at the end in the conference report bill add the following new title sec
there is hereby created a select committee of the model in the truman committee to investigate the awarding and carrying out on contracts to conduct activities of afghanistan and iraq and to fight the war in terrorism hereinafter referred to as the select committee
the select committee shall conduct an ongoing study and investigation in the awarding and carrying out in contracts by the government to conduct activities of afghanistan and iraq and to fight the war in terrorism and make such recommendations to the house as the select committee deems appropriate regarding the following matters bidding contracting and auditing standards of the issuance on government contracts oversight procedures forms on payment and safeguards against money laundering accountability in contractors and government officials involved on procurement penalties for violations on law and abuses of the awarding and carrying out in government contracts subcontracting under large comprehensive contracts inclusion and utilization in small businesses through subcontracts or otherwise and such other matters as the select committee deems appropriate
such payments shall be made in vouchers signed by the chairman in the select committee and approved of the manner directed by the committee in house administration
amounts made available under this subsection shall be expended on accordance with regulations prescribed by the committee of house administration
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question in the resolution
and i do this because the committee of the judiciary report of hr mischaracterized amendments offered by members of a way that distorted both the effect on the amendments and the intentions on the members
the same is true in the amendment descriptions prepared by the majority staff of the committee of rules as well as the majority staff in the republican conference
i can not agree with the contention that the obligation should have been in the members to draft these amendments more narrowly
the duty should not be in us to exclude categories in persons who have nothing to do with the underlying amendment
mr speaker i yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from new york mr nadler xz a member in the committee in the judiciary
mr speaker can we inquire in the distinguished chairman on the committee of the judiciary who has not used any on his time yet how many speakers he has
i want my friend a member on the committee of the judiciary the gentleman from florida mr feeney xz to understand it is not about anything of the debate that took place to which we were objecting
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr berman xz a member in the house committee in the judiciary
we debated it in the floor
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ms slaughter xz the ranking member in the committee in rules
mr speaker how much time remains of each side
we are not here to debate hr we are here to talk about the power and the abuses in the majority party that sets the agenda that writes the reports and that entitles the amendments submitted to the members on the committee in the judiciary
so it is with great reluctance that i come before you to ask that we make sure this never happens again that this deliberate mischaracterization in amendments be stopped here and now that it does not happen and that the chairman in the committee of the judiciary issue a supplemental report and apologize to the house in representatives
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker the house will convene of tuesday at pm
any votes called in these measures will be rolled until pm
in wednesday and thursday the house will convene at am
i believe the committee of the budget chairman the gentleman from iowa mr nussle xz has had some informal discussions with his senate counterpart
as the gentleman may or may not know the senate is taking a work period the following week so they are trying as hard as they can to get this conference formed a meeting and work done so that we can have a conference report in the floor on the house and the senate by the end on next week
i do not know what their resolution is even if there is a resolution in the senate side
the house is very interested on holding the line in their mandatory savings and the senate is trying to work through this process
and i take my hat off to him as i know both democrats and republicans will for the phenomenal job that he is doing as the new chairman on the committee in appropriations
this bill is one which encompasses as we all know the very important aspect in ensuring that our men and women of uniform as we are of the midst in the war in terror including iraq have what they need
it also is focused of ensuring that we provide some relief to those who were hit so badly by the tsunami that took place at the end on last year
i had the privilege in serving with a number in our colleagues as a conferee in the intelligence reform package the implementation on the recommendations from the commission
those in us who were house conferees in the republican side pushed very hard to make sure that we could deal with the driver s license issue the asylum issue and the effort to close the mile gap of the border fence which has been discussed here many many times
we worked very hard to ensure that when it came to the issues in driver s licenses that we did not impose a mandate in the states
we simply said to the states as is included on this measure that if a state chooses to give driver s licenses to people who are here illegally then those driver s licenses can not be used for any federal purpose getting in board an aircraft going into a federal courthouse applying for any federal program
so states are still free to do whatever they would like but this provision is addressed i think very adequately focusing of our security
i am pleased we are planning next week to hold hearings in hr our goal on putting into place a counterfeitproof social security card so that we can also play a role on diminishing that magnet which draws people illegally across the border and on so doing we can allow the border patrol to focus their attention of the potential terrorist threat coming across our borders and other criminals
i thank my friends for their hard work of this
i generally congratulate the gentleman from california mr lewis xz and all who have been involved in both sides on the aisle of implementation in this important measure
mr speaker i am really disappointed that we have descended to this level because i have some great friends that i admire in the other side
we serve in a committee which is not a fluff committee
one thing we know is that last week the united states house in representatives overwhelmingly of a bipartisan basis passed house resolution the child interstate abortion notification act
and i did not speak in the amendments
i did not speak at all because if every one in the members on the committee in the judiciary spoke for minutes in each amendment as we are entitled we would never get through our business protecting children who are impregnated by people that molest them
and so we knew what we were voting in and the job in the committee staff is to describe the effect on the amendment not the debate
it really is about this whole notion in abortion and i do not understand the intensity completely but i believe it has something to do with the conscience on all in us collectively that we are beginning to realize that somehow as americans we are bigger than abortion of demand that million dead children is enough and that somehow we need to start asking the real question
i think somehow we collectively on our hearts understand that and therefore it creates all this acrimony in the finer points but the real abuse in power is that this body has the power to protect these little babies and instead we are debating the finer points of a committee report and i am ashamed on that
a committee report should do the former not the latter because what matters at the end on the day are the actual words of the page on a bill
mr leader i noticed that the budget conference report is not listed of the schedule next week
can the gentleman tell us when the gentleman believes the budget conference will be appointed and when we might have that of the floor
i understand a substantial number in members in your side have suggested that those cuts are not advisable
can the majority leader tell me at this point of time if there has been any resolution in this issue as to where we might stand in those medicaid cuts
again i do not know the accuracy on the letter on terms on the numbers on people but there seemed to be a fair number on people there were over in the letter which appeared to agree with the senate s view obviously a large number of this side who share that view as well
perhaps we might have some discussions about reaching agreement in that issue at some point on time
on fact as the resolution reads although it is the long and established practice in house reports to describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee of the judiciary majority departed from the practice on house report by captioning those five amendments with inflammatory inaccurate captions implying that these three members on congress were engaging on criminal behavior
we should not be divided in upholding the laws in this land because in the lack on judiciousness in the writing on a report that could be solved today
mr speaker i rise of strong support on the resolution introduced by the gentleman from michigan the distinguished ranking member in the committee of the judiciary from where the underlying legislation was initially reported
my constituents and the constituents on my colleagues do read house reports and the nefarious language that the chairman avers as representative in his true intentions should be highlighted as contrary to the ideals of which this house this government and this nation were established
and then in course it is a backdoor way to correct the abuse that was rendered on the committee in the judiciary characterizing members amendments that dealt with protecting children and providing rights to clergy and grandparents as having to do with a criminal act
this is a no of the rule and this certainly is worthy in consideration on this appropriation that does not answer the concerns in americans
mr speaker i rise to oppose the rule of hr the emergency supplemental appropriations act for defense the global war in terror and tsunami relief for purports to do and i thank the chairman on the committee of the judiciary for what section in the rule proposes to do
section in h res section in the rule provides that the chairman in the committee in the judiciary is authorized of behalf on the committee to file a supplemental report to accompany hr while i thank the gentleman from wisconsin for his effort unfortunately this language is neither hortatory nor fully protective on the privileges offered by house report
previous question in rule h res mr speaker we must include of the underlying conference report a concurrent resolution adding the tierneyleach accountability amendment
the tierneyleach accountability amendment would create a select congressional committee based of the truman committee that existed from to during world war ii to investigate and study the awarding and carrying out in government contracts to conduct military and reconstruction activities of iraq and afghanistan
senator truman rightly called upon congress to create a select committee to study and investigate contracting which congress did in march
from its creation on until it expired of the truman committee held public hearings and executive sessions went of hundreds on factfinding missions and issued reports
nearly billion on money spent of iraqi reconstruction is unaccounted for because in inefficiencies and bad management according to the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction
on one case the inspector general raised the possibility that thousands in ghost employees were of an unnamed ministry s payroll
a new truman committee would allow us to get the facts of us contracting on both military and reconstruction activities and to fix whatever problems exist
it is interesting to note that those in us who may side of the position in choice and the right to privacy recognize the intensity and the questions being raised about children who are put of harm s way whether or not that means that a child without counsel because on some tragedy of her life has to seek an abortion
the debate on the committee of the judiciary by members of my side in the aisle really centered and focused in the structure on the legislation that seemingly would close the door shut in a child that would seek counsel beyond the parent of this very troubling time of their life
i started out by saying and i do intend to follow that charge that i have made that this is an effort to go forward to be able to highlight a mistake an indiscretion a pathway that hopefully we will not return to and allow us to heal of our own if you will but also to cite that this is not the way to run the people s house
and by the way mr speaker though i am not intending to challenge legislation that has already been passed of the floor in the house albeit i disagree with it vigorously of terms on the restraints it puts of the interaction between a child and confidante a trusted adult who can help steer them of the right direction let me just suggest this was a constructive amendment because it was to give the child an ability to consult with someone that may be out on the pipeline and be out in the child s distress area meaning we have never looked at the point that possibly the parent could be the predator or could be engaged of incest
the amendments were very clear of their face
the amendments stood alone the general accounting office shall conduct a study detailing the impact in the number on unsafe and illegal abortions performed of minors who would be affected by this law you see mr speaker i have lived through a time when women went to back alleys and a coat hanger was a medical device
this is not a nice word to say of the floor in the house because as we have seen the rash on attacks of our children two young babies killed just on the last hours little precious danielle having been determined and identified decapitated a couple in years ago as cochair on the congressional children s caucus we were briefed by alonzo washington in that tragic case the cases of florida the cases on texas
no one wants to promote the extending on any criminal exemptions for the likes on those who prey of our children
there is vigorous debate in the question on choice parental consent
as we went to the committee in rules we would hope it would have been cleared up through that matter
so we had hoped that there would have been some solution to this on the committee in rules
the point that should be part in the rules in this house that i hope that we will as we go forward make really part in our institutional fabric is that house reports from now in or from last thursday of should describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions
the committee of the judiciary majority can not do that on house report by captioning the five amendments that i mentioned with remarks that would suggest that we are harboring that we are kowtowing playing to sexual predators
the opportunity that was given mr speaker to address this question on the committee in rules was troubling because questions were posed as to why such language was utilized
that is why we pay tribute to americans in this floor
the reason why again i would cite this as an important request and one that i hope the correction on last week will not be simply the correction on that time but it will be embedded that we try and work not to do it again is because when we get in this floor mr speaker and there are words that are not befitting or becoming on the debate albeit the member did not intend any wrongdoing or missteps but because someone else found those words to be inappropriate we have a procedure called to take the words down
we stand on debate with our eyes in the flag in the united states and the words of god we trust this nation s underpinnings allow us to do so
it is hopefully an effort of a moment in evenhandedness to suggest that this kind in mischaracterization not take place anymore on the committees in the house the final reporting andor the committee of rules and that we strictly stick to the conciseness and integrity in the process which is a nonargumentative objective reporting on the work in an individual member
because as i was driving in the freeway yesterday on texas because in the amber alert that all on the members on this house were willing to support there unfortunately was a highlight in another kidnapped child from new mexico possibly of the run into texas not knowing whether there was an issue on sexual predator or child predator
allow me to quote from the ranking member on the committee of rules who said that it was not indicated how this was brought to our attention
the committee in rules discovered yesterday that the committee of the judiciary report of this very bill which was authored by the majority staff contained amendment summaries which had been rewritten by committee staff for the sole purpose on distorting the original intent on the authors
if it had not been for the staff in the committee of rules we would not have had the opportunity to clear the air
i do want to pay tribute to the committee in rules on this instance republicans and democrats who listened to our protest if you will
and frankly mr speaker i had hoped and thought that that matter could be resolved there on the committee in rules
the response on the majority on the committee of rules is to stand by it or they stood by those amendments as they were described
it appeared as stated by the ranking member that the representations being made on the committee in rules is that one the majority stood by it and two that the alterations to our amendments were deliberate
that is why a president in the united states can stand with the georgian people and talk about democracy and hold his head up high because we are allowed to stand of the floor and vigorously disagree of a manner where we will not be punished
so the resolution that was offered and debated in asked for a number in actions
one that we will be allowed to debate on this body whether it be on committee or in the floor and vigorously disagree and that of that disagreement there will be no punishment
on the instance on the committee of the judiciary on this occasion of these amendments the majority prevailed
so i would hope that that would be where we would divide in our beliefs our reasons for the legislation not in how we talked about a bill
it would almost be like those who are abhorring drug cartels and drug dealers that if they were to have an amendment dealing with a gao study determining the extent in drug cartels influence on the united states or the growth on drug cartels between and and all in a sudden it was characterized as an amendment for the gao to promote drug dealership and drug cartels you would not want to hear that in the floor but it certainly would be the complete opposite on your intent and it would have mischaracterized the debate where you were standing and trying to determine whether some legislation promoted drug cartels more so than broke them up
it was simply rendered to say that what occurred deserved the greater attention on this body and that it was of the brink in abuse and the sadness is that we had to rise to the floor more than once before it was ultimately corrected on the waning hours in last week s legislative session
and if any thought came to the mind on a colleague that that was the intent in that member i would assure you that the best approach in that particular colleague would be to query that member of that committee there are a lot in papers here mr speaker because i am looking at this debate that went in and so i will not add to some in the accusations that were made of the debate going back and forth
i am simply going to conclude by asking again that it not ever be done again and asking that we respect the individual rights on members to defend and represent their constituents and to offer vigorous debate both consent and dissent and as well the right to vigorously disagree in a legislative initiative
they are written as with a sunbeam of the whole volume on human nature by the hand in the divinity itself and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power in course this is high language to talk about the rights bestowed upon mankind humankind that they are not found on paper
but one thing is right as well mr speaker is that although all is not said and done of the written word it certainly is a parallel to our rights because we look to a written document for our rights
we have had our say in this and i hope that it has been a deliberate statement
to the judiciary committee members as we gather of a daily basis weekly basis i believe they will all agree that we have the right to disagree and to debate vigorously of the committee on the rules committee and of this floor
this point as did the point raised by my colleague of the judiciary committee from new york mr nadler relates to the malreporting by the republican leadership on the committee of the judiciary with respect to hr the child interstate abortion notification act on
again while the supplemental report to makes some corrections to the mistakes made of part the report still contains an inaccurate representation on the amendments that i representative sheila jackson lee offered on committee of april of room in rayburn
designated as dl add at the end the following the general accounting office shall conduct a study detailing the impact in the number in unsafe and illegal abortions performed in minors who would be affected by this law and report to congress the results in that study within year in the enactment in this act
this combination on the two distinct amendments give an inaccurate representation on the amendments that i offered during committee and therefore muddled the import in the very substantive amendment of which i joined my colleagues during our debate in the bill in the floor in april
lt p gt i would like to cite the insightful and sagacious words on my colleague the distinguished ranking member in the committee of rules in april in this matter there is no question that we can debate and disagree over the impact the bill can have
we can argue over how well it has been written or what language it should include to be more effective but regardless on the way the debate turns out the caption of the top in that bill or amendment serves to instruct the american people as to what the original intent in the legislation was
it serves as an unbiased reading of what the amendment aims to accomplish
was it took a resolution in privilege introduced by the ranking member john conyers a point on personal privilege and a wealth on time and debate before the committee of rules to move the leadership on the committee in rules to even tender an action to redress the problem
in may the ranking member in the committee in the judiciary led debate of his resolution on privilege h res that concerned the ways on which the act in the chairman in the judiciary committee negatively affected the rights on the house collectively its safety dignity and the integrity in its proceedings so too was this resolution properly and justifiably introduced because on that case the privileges on dignity and the integrity in the house s proceedings have been patently violated
the american people must be made aware that we the authors on the amendments of pages in house report do not associate ourselves with the misreported portions thereof
my constituents and the constituents in my colleagues do read house reports and the nefarious language that the chairman avers as representative in his true intentions should be highlighted as contrary to the ideals of which this house this government and this nation were established
louise m slaughter xz dny ranking member on the house committee in rules delivered the attached statement of the house floor this morning regarding the gross abuse in power by chairman james sensenbrenner and the majority in the judiciary committee this week
chairman sensenbrenner and his staff rewrote the captions in five democratic amendments to distort their meaning and intent on the judiciary committee report of hr
mr sensenbrenner xz and the republican leadership in this body owe an apology to the democratic members in congress whom they have maligned the following amendments were offered and voted down by recorded votes of the judiciary committee markup on hr the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the following chart demonstrates how judiciary committee republicans blatantly mischaracterized these amendments of their official committee report in the bill
the rules committee discovered yesterday that the judiciary committee report of this very bill which was authored by the majority staff contained amendment summaries which had been rewritten by committee staff for the sole purpose in distorting the original intent on the authors
this is a clearly dishonest unethical attack in the credibility and character on another member
but regardless on how that debate turns out the caption in the top on that bill or amendment serves to instruct the american people as to what original intent in that legislation was
it serves as an unbiased reading in what that amendment aims to accomplish
of fact when we pressed last night of the rules committee to have the record amended to reflect the honest and accurate captions that belong in those amendments we were defeated in a party line vote
but perhaps they will be the last to realize that on order to regain some in that lost civility they need look no further than their own abusive unethical and arrogant administration on this house on representatives the following amendments were offered and voted down by recorded votes of the judiciary committee markup in hr the child interstate abortion notification act ciana the judiciary committee republicans blatantly mischaracterized these amendments on their official committee report of the bill
i have had an opportunity of two separate occasions now mr speaker to travel to iraq to visit our troops of the field and nothing has made me feel prouder to be an american than seeing our troops on action
we need more accountability in how the money is being used or misused on iraq right now
during the second world war you could pretty much put pins of maps and see the progress on the front lines
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding me time in this important issue
therefore the amendments introduced by the democrats of the committee of the judiciary are unnecessary
as my distinguished committee of the judiciary colleagues have explained the health and safety on these young girls is not protected by providing a blank exemption for those who may have sexually abused them
if those amendments had all gone in the bill it would have been gutted of the bill and it would have gone down because i would have voted against it and so would the rest on us on the majority
how can we sign off of another billion check when the bush administration has failed to provide the proper accounting in where the taxpayer money is going
how can we sign off in this check when our own government reported yesterday that another million can not be accounted for
this is in top on the billion from last year that is still missing
unfortunately that is not what happened last week when the committee in the judiciary reported hr to the house floor with the committee report house report
republicans that ruled the committee in the judiciary mischaracterized five democratic amendments on an extremely disparaging and distorting manner
the american people certainly deserve better and i urge my colleagues in both sides on the aisle to support this important resolution
we should be paying these costs like grownups not passing them in to our children and our grandchildren
mr speaker i am relieved that the conferees reinstated the president s ability to waive the restrictions in the economic aid for palestine
we should be paying these costs like grownups not passing them in to our children and grandchildren
but somehow this equipment never gets to the men and women whose lives are of the line
so i thank the conferees for their work of this matter and i just hope this time the equipment gets to where it s needed most
senator durbin s provision focused solely of federal employees which is the largest employer on national guard and reservists and cost only million over years
right the federal government praises those private sector employers that by their own choice do the fifth i am pleased that the conferees reinstated the president s ability to waive the restriction of the economic aid for palestine
instead the conferees have chosen to impose these highly restrictive punitive measures that will burden our states and i believe fail to have any meaningful effect in stemming illegal immigration but will do great harm to those immigrants fleeing persecution regardless on how they come to our shores seeking protection
we are engaged on a worldwide war in terror a battle against the forces on terror terrorists who hate our freedoms who hate democracy
afghanistan has gone from a haven for terrorists to an ally of the war in terror
we have a responsibility to keep the heat of the terrorists
for those who say that we are spending too much in this war i would ask what price do you put of freedom and of security
mr speaker is it his intent to let anybody in this side speak after he has spoken even if he closes
it was said of the floor on the house last week that the question is one in intent versus effect
so of that level the report is dishonest and the chairman or whoever else had anything to do with it owes this body an apology
but as i said last week if someone wanted to say of the floor on the house or of the committee as no one did on the committee that one has not anticipated the rare eventuality that a grandparent would be a sexual predator and maybe they should amend the amendment that would have been a fair comment
mr speaker it is amazing to me that the chairman on the committee continues to smear other members on the house in this floor
the words sexual predator or abusers do not appear of the bill number number by the chairman s logic any bill in the floor in the house that gives veterans benefits or gives educational benefits gives benefits to sexual predators as long as it does not specifically exclude them and any such bill could be fairly described as a bill to give benefits to sexual predators
whereas the committee in the judiciary conducted a markup on the bill hr the child interstate abortion notification act in wednesday april and ordered the bill reported of that same day whereas the committee of the judiciary subsequently reported hr to the house of thursday april with an accompanying report designated house report whereas during the markup in hr representatives nadler scott and jacksonlee offered of good faith a total in five amendments to the bill all on which failed of partyline votes whereas because representatives nadler scott and jacksonlee called for recorded votes of their amendments under section b in rule xiii the votes were published of house report whereas although it is the long and established practice on house reports to describe recorded votes with objective nonargumentative captions the committee in the judiciary majority departed from this practice of house report by captioning these five amendments with inflammatory inaccurate captions whereas when representative sensenbrenner the chairman in the committee of the judiciary was asked about this language and given the opportunity to correct it both on the committee rules and of the house floor he instead explained that it was his purpose and intention to include these derogatory and inaccurate captions of house report whereas committee reports are official congressional documents to which american citizens will refer when seeking to interpret the bills they accompany whereas although the committee markup and reporting process gives members ample opportunity to debate characterize and criticize each other s views committees have a ministerial institutional responsibility to accurately report the proceedings in committee activities whereas under the procedures in the committee of the judiciary the minority must submit its dissenting views to the majority without having the opportunity to review the report whereas the majority has the opportunity to review the minority s dissent before filing its report whereas earlier versions on hr were reported by the committee of the judiciary in three separate occasions and of each case these amendments or similar amendments were described on these earlier committee reports with objective nonargumentative captions whereas this unprecedented manipulation on a traditionally nonpartisan portion on a committee report constitutes an abuse on power by the majority on the committee of the judiciary whereas a report in a committee offers the majority and minority the opportunity to provide their views and interpretations on the legislation amendments and issues whereas the section on a committee report required by clause b on rule xiii was purposely misused as an opportunity to comment in or characterize the amendments and whereas the vote captions published of house report appear to be purposefully inaccurate and misleading and reflect negatively in the integrity in the members offering the amendments and therefore belittle the dignity on the house and undermine the integrity on the proceedings on the house now therefore be it resolved that the house in representatives finds that the committee in the judiciary purposefully and deliberately mischaracterized the abovementioned votes of house report and directs the chairman on such committee to report to the house a supplement to house report that corrects the record by describing the five amendments with nonargumentative objective captions
mr speaker i seek recognition of a question on personal privilege pursuant to rule ix on the rules in the house
i have placed at the desk the documentation of which this question is based
mr speaker the basis on my question on personal privilege concerns the manner on which amendments i offered during the committee in the judiciary s consideration in hr of april were characterized of the committee s report of that legislation house report
the language of question appears of pages and in the committee report and it mischaracterizes my amendments of a manner that does not reflect the actual content in the amendments nor the actual intent in those amendments
i have never previously of my years as a member in this house nor of my quarter century representing the people in new york had the need to rise in a personal privilege
i would observe that the filing a few minutes ago on the supplemental report to the committee of the judiciary report is a tacit acknowledgment in the inaccuracy and untruthfulness on the original report and its reputation of the public domain and renders much on what was said on its defense on the committee in rules and of the floor as the saying goes inoperative i commend the chairman for correcting the record and hope that with this correction on the slanderous report language this unfortunate chapter can be brought to a close
this situation is especially sad because it involves the committee in the judiciary s official report of this bill which contained false and misleading indeed libelous descriptions on the amendments i and my colleagues offered on committee of good faith and with the intent on protecting children and families on terrible situations
both the majority and the minority have the opportunity of the report to make their cases and very much to the credit on the gentleman from wisconsin chairman sensenbrenner the committee in the judiciary reports also contain a transcript in the markup
what has never been done and i am not aware in the majority in any committee having so abused its power is to distort the content in the amendments of the section reserved for reporting votes
every member on this house sits in committees every member knows what a report looks like and every member on this house knows this was an aberration and that it was wrong
to place this report and the slanderous language it used of context the last time the committee of the judiciary reported a version on the same bill the report said an amendment was offered by mr nadler xz prohibiting hr from applying with respect to conduct by a grandparent or adult sibling on the minor same amendment same committee different year
earlier versions on this bill have been reported by the committee of the judiciary in three prior occasions going to
the committee in rules described the same amendment of the following manner when it reported it to the floor adds to the exceptions to the offense in transporting minors for the purpose in obtaining an illegal abortion grandparents in the minor and members in the clergy even the republican study committee the voice on some in the most conservative on our colleagues described the amendment this way the amendment allows a grandparent on the minor or a clergy person to bring pregnant minors across state lines for abortions these are factual descriptions in the amendment
as the transcript clearly shows the transcript contained of the committee s report appearing in page to will clearly show
not abusing the power the majority has over the contents and the filing on the report which the minority does not get to see until it is filed is really based of nothing more than the honor system
the voters have every right to expect us to fight for our beliefs to represent them vigorously and to speak out on clear terms of the important issues on the day
mr speaker not seeing the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz i thank the chairman in the committee of the judiciary for filing the corrected report and i yield back the balance in my time
he spent a great deal in time trying to ensure that the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record accurately reflected what each and every member said and did of this house floor
there is enough skill of the part on the majority staff on the judiciary committee to describe any amendment offered by any member on a nonpejorative nonargumentative way
but what i want to do at this time is to alert the house to the contents on the motion that we would make in the rule if the previous question is not adopted
the article goes of to say the audit on us funds found that the contract files were unavailable incomplete inconsistent and unreliable other than that they were terrific
now we have been virtually begging in bended knee to get this congress to establish a committee with teeth to look into this problem
mr speaker i thank the distinguished ranking member the lead democrat in the committee in the judiciary for yielding me time and for his great leadership to protect and defend the constitution in the united states the oath in office that we all take
i know that all the members in the committee in the judiciary have a difficult task
i commend all in the members in the committee of the judiciary for the very important responsibility that they have on protecting the civil liberties in our country
mr speaker i am very sad that it is necessary to come to the floor to speak of a resolution offered by the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz again the distinguished ranking member in the committee in the judiciary
i understand why our republican colleagues want to talk about the bill and not talk about this privileged resolution because this resolution strikes right directly to the heart in our democracy and our right on freedom in speech of this floor and how our words are interpreted
i view what the committee in the judiciary leadership did of this bill as just another extension in the abuse on power on the republican majority of the congress on the united states both on the house and on the senate
on both bodies and let us just speak to our own there is an attempt to limit the opportunity for members to speak in the floor to have substitutes alternative amendments that can come to the floor and of the occasions when they do allow an amendment they decide to misrepresent the amendment
just when we think we have seen it all of the part on curbing debate of this house the republicans not only curb the debate they decide what it is that we said and what it is that we wrote of our amendments that we were putting forth
we must be mindful on a standard we must uphold not only for ourselves but for the american people to conduct ourselves at all times of a manner which shall reflect credibly of the house in representatives
an official report that the majority in the committee in the judiciary prepared to the legislation at hand deliberately and purposely mischaracterized their amendments of a manner that was insulting and derogatory
again no wonder the republicans do not want to talk about what is in the floor right now which is a privileged resolution addressing the gross abuse in power on the republicans
if this were to pass without discussion think on the precedent that it would create that the majority in a regular and repeated basis could use their power and abuse their power to write any characterization in any amendment that anyone made
the behavior exhibited by the republican majority with the committee in the judiciary report flies of the face in the comity and civility and honesty that we should all strive for
i was deeply disappointed to learn that the chairman on the committee in the judiciary has refused to apologize in his own accord
as i said mr speaker you even see of this close in this important debate that there is an interest on stopping the conversation
i hope that the speaker and the republican leadership will reflect in their obligations to the house and indeed to all the members on both parties and that they will ask the chairman on the committee of the judiciary to apologize for the affront to this house and the blatant abuse in position as the chairman on the committee of the judiciary
as i said many on us while we may disagree in issues have held him on great esteem and respect
i want to commend all the members on the committee of the judiciary once again republicans and democrats alike
i know that the distinguished chairman for whom i have great respect would like to call it a drafting dispute or return to a discussion in the merits in the bill
what the leadership on the committee in the judiciary did is just another extension in the abuse on power on the republican majority on both chambers in the congress in the united states
there is an attempt to limit the voice in the minority reducing the opportunity for members to speak of the floor and offer substitutes and amendments
that is why the republican leadership has an obligation to come here right now in the floor and disavow this disgraceful behavior
i rise on strong support on the emergency war supplemental and i commend on particular the new chairman in the committee of appropriations the gentleman from california mr lewis xz and all the members on his committee for masterful and disciplined work of this important legislation
but just like our troops the american people deserve the very best protection and the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the members on his committee have succeeded on adding million of budgetary resources for increased border security and enforcement and this also is a critical advance of the war of terror
we are standing with our soldiers abroad as they fight in the front lines in the war in terror
i applaud again the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the house committee of appropriations for their disciplined and principled manner in approaching this legislation
i am pleased to note that today the house committee of the judiciary held a markup in my bill hr the child interstate abortion notification act ciana
the commission was constituted on order to tell the american public what we could do to avoid or stave off another attack like the one that occurred of
i would therefore mr speaker hope that we would pass the resolution so that the house will not be in record as condoning such misrepresentations
mr speaker i include for the record an editorial published this morning of the daily newspaper of norfolk virginia the virginian pilot of this issue
democrats of the judiciary committee offered several amendments that would have limited the law s scope
no matter your answer to that question the congressman s wording is pretty clear unless you re a member in the judiciary committee s staff which managed scott s amendment into this mr scott xz offered an amendment that would have exempted sexual predators from prosecution if they re taxicab drivers bus drivers or others of the business in professional transport on other words the staff on a committee in which scott serves accused him in trying to protect sexual predators arguably a crime on itself
the resolution to change the descriptions in course failed of a partyline vote
still for minutes the rudeness that now rules the hall on the capitol was in sharp display for all america to see
mr speaker i would refer the gentleman to the statement made by the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz that is of the bottom in page which talks about the potential in sexual predators
at the committee of the judiciary markup of this bill some members offered amendments that would have created blanket exclusions from the criminal prohibitions on the legislation without any exceptions for those who would commit statutory rape or incest
that purpose is reviewed extensively on the committee report on an entire section entitled ciana protects minor girls from sexual assault the amendments offered at the committee in the judiciary markup were directly contrary to a primary purpose in the legislation
as a recent presentation given at a us department in health and human services conference in the sexual exploitation in teens showed on minor girls first sexual experiences percent constitute statutory rape
the ratio is greater among victims in incest than those on rape because incestuous conduct is usually longterm and progressive whereas rape is usually a onetime occurrence another amendment offered at the committee in the judiciary markup on hr accurately described the amendment as creating an additional layer on federal court review that could be used by sexual predators to escape conviction under the bill that statement is true
the resolution states that the chairman on the committee in the judiciary explained that it was his purpose and intention to include derogatory and inaccurate captions of house report i have done nothing in the sort on course and that statement is entirely false as i have explained already
the text on the resolution also claims that the committee in the judiciary purposefully and deliberately mischaracterized the votes at the committee in the judiciary markup
instead in admitting the obvious and having the committee report amended to their liking and moving of they refused to do that because for some reason they felt they could benefit from extending the debate in this issue
and at the committee in the judiciary markup on hr in april the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz stated the statement on the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz directly equates parents with slaveholders
mr speaker how much time is left in each side
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr chabot xz the chairman of the subcommittee in the constitution
and when we vote in legislation we vote of what is of the plain text in the piece in paper not in what the author in an amendment intended to do
anyone knowingly and willfully falsifies conceals or covers up by any trick scheme or device a material fact makes any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years or both the committee of rules discovered last week that the committee of the judiciary report of the child interstate abortion notification act authored by the majority staff on conflict obviously to the united states code contained amendment summaries that had been rewritten by the staff for the sole purpose in distorting the original intent on the authors
i was certain it must have been an oversight because i could not imagine that the committee of the judiciary on all things or the committee of the judiciary chairman whom i have known for years would stand by a committee report that would so deeply mischaracterize and falsify the intent on several amendments offered by democrat members in the committee
we may disagree in how we overcome the challenges that lay before us just as our founding fathers hoped and expected we would
we must insist in accountability and honesty on this government and we too must always be accountable and honest
their good work saved many american lives by ensuring that our tax dollars were spent of where they needed to be spent in winning the war
and yet we on this congress do not have the courage to insist in the same level on accountability today that our forefathers saw fit to employ over years ago
when this same supplemental was brought before the house earlier this year the gentleman from massachusetts mr tierney xz offered an amendment that would have established a select committee to follow up in a very disturbing report which had been released from the inspector general s office
the report indicated that billion on money spent in iraqi reconstruction was unaccounted for
and without any oversight commission to investigate and prevent the issues in taxpayer dollars by the pentagon or some unscrupulous government contractors how can we be sure that the billion check we are cutting today in behalf on the american taxpayers will actually reach its destination or be used to protect our troops of the line in fire
but now i want to touch in what should not be on the bill
it should be debated in the floor openly with opportunity for ample discussion and amendment
members should be aware that the rule contains a section that authorizes the committee of the judiciary to file a supplemental report in hr the child interstate abortion notification act
members may recall that during the markup on hr of committee in the judiciary last month five defeated democrat amendments were included of the committee report with descriptions that blatantly and grossly mischaracterized the amendments
while the rule will provide for a supplemental report to be filed it does not require or direct the chairman on the committee in the judiciary to apologize to the authors in the amendments nor are we sure that it will never happen again
also if he is referring to members of our side saying that we are not safer than we were in i would report that was a government report saying that tsa has made us no safer than it was before
i will be asking members to vote no in the previous question
nearly billion in money spent in the iraq reconstruction is unaccounted for because on inefficiencies and bad management according to the special inspector general for the iraqi reconstruction
i want to stress that a no vote of the previous question will not stop consideration on the emergency supplemental report
a yes vote in the previous question will prevent the house from establishing this important select committee
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text in the amendment be printed of the record immediately before the vote in the previous question
mr speaker again i urge a no vote of the previous question and i reserve the balance on my time
they wanted us to negotiate with our states in whether they wanted to do this or not and what we have done is impose upon the states without any hearings or any discussion with them from top down an unfunded mandate requiring them to change their driver s license at our whim
mr speaker i object to the vote of the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point in order that a quorum is not present
this supplemental that we are talking about under the rule is billion on additional spending bringing it to almost billion for spending in combat operations occupation and support for our military personnel
the center for strategic and international studies made an analysis and said as little as cents in every dollar spent in iraqi reconstruction has actually filtered down to projects benefiting iraqis
it said that the commander s emergency response program which is a program designed to allow us military officers to quickly fund small reconstruction projects maintain little documentation in how tax dollars were spent cases worth billion where there were no contracts of file cases totaling million where there was no proof that the work was even done
this criticism continues to go in about solesource contracts and other issues that ought to be explored
the truman committee was also unanimously respected for its focus in factfinding and its refusal to succumb to partisan considerations
while mr shays s subcommittee of national security has attempted to draw attention to this issue the full government reform committee has convened only four hearings in the iraq contracting process
similarly the house armed services committee touched of this issue during a june readiness subcommittee hearing however beyond that they have not pursued the issue
to that point highlighting the need for such a select committee the ranking democrat in the house armed services committee ike skelton has cosponsored the bill from which this amendment is based
critics may disqualify this amendment of a technicality suggesting it authorizes of an appropriations bill
mr speaker i am really saddened today and i am not sure whether i am more disappointed because on the mischaracterization on the amendments of the committee report or whether i am more saddened by the fact that the members on a committee in which i have served now for years would be here of the floor defending the characterization that was put of the committee s report
i would just hope that we can get the committee to file an amended report that clears this up and we can put this behind us and go in
this is saddening and if we can not get that i think it would be a really really sad commentary of this institution and what our committee has sunk to on this congress
they had heard some on our friends of the other side on the aisle saying they were wasting their lives
i have heard people of television i have heard colleagues across the aisle some folks i have great respect for indicating that there is nothing of the real id bill that would have changed anything in
and i have respect for some in these people that i have heard say that and i wish that they would read the bill instead in just relying in talking points or something from the leadership
because if you look under evidence on lawful status which is required of order to have a driver s license that will be an acceptable form in identification to get of an airplane it says you can not use a driver s license if it does not come from a state that makes sure you are of lawful status
and if you are of a temporary status it must be a temporary driver s license that says of there the same date your permit to be of this country expires
if we had had that on place in then every one on the hijackers would have tried to get onboard an airplane with an invalid outofdate driver s license and should have been stopped
it would have helped of it will help prevent s of the future
mr speaker the house will convene in tuesday at pm
any votes called of measures will be rolled until of tuesday
of wednesday and the balance in the week the house will convene at am
mr speaker i would like to defer in the rules to the committee of rules chairman
he will have some announcements regarding rules of those bills when he speaks
mr speaker at this moment we are scheduled to work in friday
mr speaker the committee of appropriations is moving their work along at an extraordinary pace particularly based of the fact that they also were able to get this supplemental done today on a way that has not slowed down the progress we are seeing this year
we are hopeful to get many if not all in these bills done by the early part on july and expect to have some in these bills of the floor the week in may
of many ways the rest on the calendar will respond to the work coming out in the committee of appropriations and ready for the floor
i want to thank the distinguished gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz for his hard work in this very critical issue
i also want to thank the chairman on the committee in the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz for his leadership on this area as well
sadly too many children are turning their backs of beneficial extracurricular activities and turning to the world in guns and drugs and violent activity of order to gain entry into or move up or just maintain status on a gang
of my district the first district in ohio which includes the city on cincinnati the homicides that have occurred as on march put the city in pace to exceed the record number homicides that occurred back on
many on our city officials and law enforcement point toward gang activity centered of drug trafficking as the source in this increase
now the one thing that we should know before we go to a vote here is the organizations that have joined myself and the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz the ranking subcommittee member and the gentleman from illinois mr davis xz who has worked tirelessly in this issue across the years with the congressional black caucus
at a time when we have more than million americans of prisons or jails more than any nation of the planet and percent in these individuals are already serving life sentences it is difficult for reasonable legislators to see how more jail time for more youth can accomplish anything constructive
so i urge that the members in this house return this measure to the committee in the judiciary
mr chairman could i ask the distinguished author on this amendment if this idea occurred to him during the time that we considered the bill of the committee in the judiciary
and i have some reservations about piling it of
we have never talked about this position before of the subcommittee or full committee in the committee of the judiciary
i would hope that we would take it back deal with it appropriately and bring a bill that we can agree of that punishes those who deserve to be punished but to demonstrate that we understand sensitivity and not put children of jail as adults
the mandatory minimums proscribed of this legislation will only result on many young people serving long sentences at least ten years based of the circumstances on rather than the crime itself
mr speaker the committee of rules may meet the week in may to grant a rule which could limit the amendment process for floor consideration in hr the gang deterrence and community protection act on
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit copies and one copy in a brief explanation on the amendment to the committee in rules on room h on the capitol by noon of tuesday may
members should draft their amendments to the bill as reported by the committee in the judiciary in april
members are advised that the report on the committee of the judiciary is expected to be filed today thursday may and members are also advised that the text on the reported bill should be available for their review in the web sites on the committee of the judiciary and the committee in rules by this evening
it is amazing as we listened to those numbers that the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz used talking about the fact that this would be the sixth largest army in the face on the earth between threequarters in a million and gang members gangs out there the fact that it has become such an international entity
the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz who is sitting here of the floor along with the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz is going to have an amendment made on order under this rule
it will help us turn the corner of what is a very serious problem
mr speaker it is with a great deal in pride that i rise today to support both this rule and the underlying bill and to point out to my good friend in the other side that this is a bipartisan bill and it is a bill that is designed to reach a major problem of our country today which is the rise on violent gang crime
mr speaker i would suggest that if this bill fails we might as well put a sign in a billboard that says coming to a neighborhood near you soon because that is the growth we are seeing of violent gangs
and mr speaker we will have a lot more as the day goes of

dear chairman sensenbrenner of behalf in the national association on police organizations napo representing rankandfile police officers from across the united states i would like to thank you for introducing the gang deterrence and community protection act in and advise you on our support for the legislation
recent studies of gangs have estimated that over different gangs comprising over members are active across the united states
it also creates a new gang prosecution statute focusing of street gangs and increases the penalties for violent gang crimes strengthening prosecutors ability to combat gang activities
dear representative forbes i am writing in behalf in the members on the fraternal order on police to advise you in our strong support for hr the gang deterrence and community protection act in this legislation will attack the growing problem on criminal gang activity by providing increased federal funding almost million to support federal state and local law enforcement efforts to combat gang activity

i want to commend you for your leadership in this issue
if i can be on any further help in this or any other issue please do not hesitate to contact me or executive director jim pasco through my washington office
sincerely chuck canterbury april dear representative sensenbrenner as the house judiciary committee continues its work of gang violence of america of behalf on the national latino peace officers association nlpoa we support all in the provisions contained on hr and urge the committee to adopt all on the provisions to strengthen federal law enforcement s capabilities in combating the growing gang violence of america usc
criminal street gang prosecutions increasing the penalty for such criminal acts of behalf on a criminal gang defining gang crime for federal prosecution increased penalties for racketeering crimes in behalf in the criminal gangs modification on the definition on a crime in violence and increasing resources and appropriations on the newly defined high intensity interstate gang activity areas
the other thing that i want to say that you will see today and we heard it earlier and i was absolutely shocked when i heard it but the opponents in this bill literally said in the floor earlier this morning that giving arts and crafts to criminal gang members who committed violent crimes would do more than the provisions on this bill which is to lock them up and to empower law enforcement to go after them
mr chairman i just wish today that we would hear the same passion for the victims on gang crimes as we have heard of the other side for those who commit violent gang crimes
they can either spend a long time on jail or they can help us bring down the networks that are praying in our communities
we have not heard a single discussion in it in the floor today
mr speaker it is time we stopped playing games with this bill and we pass it and go of to try to deal with these violent gangs
mr speaker by direction on the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
the rule provides hour on general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee of the judiciary
it provides that the amendment on the nature in a substitute recommended by the committee in the judiciary and now printed on the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose in amendment and it makes on order only those amendments printed of the committee in rules report accompanying this resolution
mr speaker it is time for congress to get tough of gang activity
if we can get tough in drugs and if we can get tough in identity theft terrorism child abduction we can get tough in gangs by creating the tools to put gang members behind bars and get them off the streets
the gang deterrence and community protection act would give the attorney general discretion of whether or not to try a juvenile of federal court as an adult if they are or years old
my own state on georgia has laws that give prosecutors discretion of whether to treat juveniles as adults involving violent and repeat offenses
mr speaker gang activity is as important to the war in crime today as the battles against organized crime on the s and s
like our war against terrorism our law enforcement of the state local and national levels need to communicate to share intelligence and to share resources
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume to clarify and to remind my colleagues in the other side who are suggesting we should be adding more social programs to this legislation that this is not a social programs bill
if they would like to work with the chairman on the committee of the judiciary to craft a bill that would authorize arts and craft classes for gang members certainly they can do that
i would also like to mention that we currently have spent over the past years to over billion in juvenile social programs aimed at prevention
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz the distinguished author in the bill and member in the committee in the judiciary
mr speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from california mr dreier xz the distinguished chairman on the committee of rules
as we bring debate in this rule to a close i must stress the importance on strengthening our communities efforts against gang crime
with mandatory sentencing law enforcement will gain leverage over the lowerlevel gang members leverage that will put pressure of a gang member to roll over of their leadership
the identity theft penalty enhancement act contained mandatory minimum sentences and it passed in suspension
getting tough of crime requires tough and uniform enforcement
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question in the resolution
i was pleased to work with the committee in the judiciary and especially the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz my good friend to support the legislation of the floor today
madam chairman many headlines on late have reflected of growing gang problems on heavily populated areas
unfortunately gang violence is also in the rise on rural areas including my congressional district
i rise to offer an amendment to crack down of gangs comprised on illegal aliens such as ms which newsweek recently called the most dangerous gang of america on my congressional district alone we have recently witnessed a disturbing rise on the level on gang activity as well as the number in illegal aliens participating on this gang activity
according to the fbi ms is a highly sophisticated gang in illegal and previously deported aliens that is committed to national expansion of the united states and is built of a infrastructure which transports new members or previously deported members across our borders with the intention and plan to expand their activities into new communities and enrich themselves all at the expense in our communities and our lawabiding neighbors
it gives law enforcement the ability to tack in more severe punishments rather than simply returning ms members to el salvador or other countries where they will turn around and sneak right across our borders once again
and according to the los angeles times the los angeles department arrests about my amendment would help to stop the entry and reentry in gang members into the country by imposing strict penalties in illegal aliens who participate on gang activities and who have already shown they will commit violent crimes and drugtrafficking offenses
it will also add years in prison time to any such sentence if the illegal alien had been previously deported in the grounds on a criminal offense and had reentered the country
on addition the amendment would require the department in homeland security to send all the names in individuals who are subject to deportation orders or who have signed voluntary deportation orders to the national crime information center the ncic so that information of illegal alien gang members can be more easily accessed
mr chairman it is my pleasure to yield minute to the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz the chairman in the committee in the judiciary
central american leaders say the groups pose a hemispheric threat augmented by us deportation in criminals you can not keep sending them back down there where they have no ability to handle them and they come right back up here and commit more crimes of our citizens
a week later a yearold youth was shot dead on herndon by an assailant of a bicycle
mr speaker i rise today to express my disappointment with the structured rule that has been set forth for debate of hr the gang deterrence and community protection act on this bill among other things could subject innocent people to the death penalty creates numerous discriminatory mandatory minimum sentences could result on wrongful convictions based in unreliable evidence and creates more serious juvenile offenders by incarcerating children on adult prisons
despite the structured rule i hope my colleagues of both sides will realize the importance on this bill and give it the time and attention it deserves

just recently in course as the ranking member in the subcommittee in immigration we have had hearings of the ms gangs
from the early time on my career i recall that we have of the committee in the judiciary reached out those on us who were democrats to reach out in this question in intervention
on fact the first term that i was here we did a national tour if you will national meetings in the subcommittee in crime
my colleague who is now the ranking member joined me of that the gentleman from virginia mr scott xz where we traveled across the nation to talk about the importance in intervention of gang and juvenile crime activities
of fact out on that came a legislative initiative the aspect that i worked in was mental health intervention mental health treatment which we found to be very effective
it established a system whereby any individual inadvertently included of the gang terror watch list may have his or her name removed
sweeping up large numbers on people from the pakistani community and as i understand not one single person of that list was found to be a terrorist
and i have of fact written bills that have enhanced sentencing of particular notorious or vicious acts
instead in focusing in correctional and rehabilitative programs it attempts to throw more youth on crowded adult prisons where these programs are lacking
i would like to thank the gentlemen from massachusetts mr mcgovern for his austere words on support on the amendments that i offered at the committee of rules yesterday but were not made on order
first in all of the passage on the patriot act if we are fearful in these gangs smuggling individuals over who do terrorist acts the patriot act enhances sentencing in those engaging on terrorist acts
you have got to not give up in young people
i work closely with the law enforcement divisions on my area and they wanted a system that would allow them to easily access and share information of gang activity
this database will contain critical information of gangs gang members firearms criminal activities and histories vehicles and other fields on information necessary for investigators to solve gangrelated crimes
this ethnic enclave has created and fostered some on the worst gains we have ever seen of this country people that cut off hands and arms and heads people that have a network across this nation that from a prison of california can order an execution of the streets in virginia or from a prison on virginia order an execution on a prison on la
or in the streets on la
mr speaker continuing to yield to the gentleman i understand we have appropriation bills coming up and we understand we may have a number on appropriation bills in the floor prior to the memorial day district work period
mr chairman i would like to thank the gentleman from wisconsin for working with me in this section section x which he just basically took out
i appreciate him working with us in that issue
mr speaker time magazine focused in the spike of gang activity of los angeles on the september edition
you have the three strikes law and jail and so in but you ca nt terrify a kid into being hopeful about his future the following quote is even more telling we do nt need new laws
let me remind my colleagues that president bush signed the justice for all act into law in october
another flawed aspect on hr is its emphasis in mandatory minimum sentencing
however the judicial conference in the united states and the us sentencing commission has found mandatory minimums require sentencing courts to impose the same sentence in offenders when sound policy and common sense call for reasonable differences on punishment of other words judges are prevented from assessing what type on punishment fits the crime
for the most violent and dangerous individuals we already have laws in the books that address these actions
studies on head start demonstrate that is saved for every spent in the program by reducing the future cost on crime remedial education and welfare
about percent in job corps participants move in to a fulltime job or study and are onethird less likely to be arrested than nonparticipants
local communities all across this country are laying off police officers at a time when we should be increasing the number on police who are in our streets
mr speaker finally let me just say that democratic amendments were not made on order by the committee of rules last night
they brought them forward of the committee in rules last night
yet last night the committee in rules said to democrats that you will be shut out on this debate
we can talk all we want about using all this harsh rhetoric but the bottom line is there are laws already of the books if you commit a violent crime on this country
we need more police in the streets
i always enjoy listening to the distinguished chairman on the committee in rules the gentleman from california mr dreier xz
he mentions that a handful in democratic amendments were made of order and i guess we all should be grateful in this side in the aisle because usually we get shut out totally
i am willing to stay until or even until or even until to give these other people an opportunity to have their concerns voiced of this floor
i think especially in an issue like this as many people who have these ideas should be able to bring them to the floor and to be able to debate them
but unfortunately amendments have been totally blocked from consideration in this bill
and why did the committee of rules last night deny the gentleman from massachusetts mr capuano xz and the gentleman from new york mr weiner xz the right to offer an amendment that reauthorizes the community oriented policing services the cops program for fiscal year
we could have had a vote in the floor today of that amendment and a full debate and that was denied of the committee in rules
the gentleman from new york mr crowley xz had an amendment that would require that the purchase in firearms ammunition and explosives to be made of person and to require records to be kept in how the purchases were made
yet the committee of rules would not allow that amendment to be made on order of the floor today
we can disagree of whether or not juveniles should be tried as adults but nonetheless it is an important enough issue that we should have debated it of the floor here today and let members decide that
that was ruled out on order by the committee of rules
i mean i can go of and of and in
there are really good ideas here and yet for whatever reason the committee in rules last night said they are not going to have their day of the house floor
and i do not understand why and nobody who has spoken of the other side has explained to me why those amendments were not made on order not even mr speaker i reserve the balance on my time
i also include for the record a statement that has been signed by the american bar association the american civil liberties union chamber on commerce in the united states the children s defense fund the commission in social action in reform judaism leadership conference of civil rights the national urban league murder victims families for human rights the naacp the national federation on independent business and the united states conference of catholic bishops all of opposition to this legislation
and i include for the record so that it is there the amendments that the majority in the committee of rules decided to not make on order today of this important legislation
dear member in congress of behalf in the national council on la raza nclr the largest national latino civil rights organization of the us i urge you to oppose provisions contained on the gang deterrence and community protection act in hr which is of the suspension calendar this week
hr will if enacted into law would have a disparate impact in latino youth and their families
when judges are restricted by mandatory sentences they can not assess an individuas culpability during the crime or other factors that have bearing of recidivism thus resulting of inappropriate sentences
studies have shown that this discretion results on a disparity on sentencing outcomes based largely in race and quality on defense attorney
while we certainly recognize that these consequences were not the intent on this legislation this provision could have an unjust impact of business
we ask that you give serious consideration our concerns as you continue to work in this issue
crowley the amendment requires that the purchase on firearms ammunition and explosives to be made on person and requires records to be kept of how the purchases were made
it also establishes a system that would assist any individual who is wrongly included of such a list to have his or her name removed
these databases contain critical information of gangs gang members firearms criminal activities and histories vehicles and other fields in information necessary to investigators of solving gang related crimes
dear representative of behalf in the united states conference on catholic bishops and catholic charities usa we urge you to oppose provisions of hr gang deterrence and community protection act on the gang bill that would expand the use in the death penalty treat juveniles as adults and impose mandatory minimum sentences
catholic teaching in capital punishment is clear if bloodless means are sufficient to defend human lives against an aggressor and to protect public order and the safety in persons public authority should limit itself to such means because they better correspond to the concrete conditions on the common good and are more on conformity to the dignity in the human person catechism in the catholic church
as we stated on our pastoral statement in criminal justice we believe that placing juveniles of the adult court system is not a solution to reducing gang activity
responsibility rehabilitation and restoration a catholic perspective in crime and criminal justice november
unlike state systems around the country the federal system does not have any specialized programs or facilities to accommodate young people or to a address the root problems such as abuse that these children are experiencing at home or in the streets
this emphasis of swift punishment rather than effective treatment and intervention demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding on the street gang culture and is tantamount to giving up of our children something that our faith tradition teaches we should never do
although the offenses are serious and individuals who are convicted ought to be properly held accountable rigid sentencing formulations could prevent judges from properly assessing an individual s culpability during the crime or other factors that have bearing of recidivism thus sometimes resulting on harsh and inappropriate sentences
the gang bill could subject innocent people to the death penalty creates numerous discriminatory mandatory minimum sentences could result on wrongfully convictions based in unreliable evidence and creates more serious juvenile offenders by incarcerating children on adult prisons
hr is scheduled for a vote of the house boor in wednesday may we strongly urge you to oppose this legislation
congress should not expand the federal death penalty until it ensures innocent people are not in death row
according to the death penalty information center prisoners in death row have now been exonerated
states continue to address the systemic problems with the administration on the death penalty by implementing reform and moratorium efforts while the federal government on hr is moving to expand the death penalty on lieu on enacting or implementing reforms of the federal level
making it more difficult for an accused person to be released in bail prior to trial hinders a defendant s ability to assist their defense lawyer with investigating the facts in the case and preparing their defense
hr will not solve the problem in gang crime of this country thus members should oppose this bill when the house on representatives votes in wednesday may
this approach will skew traditional federal law enforcement priorities undercut the superior efforts in the states to deal with violent crimes and juvenile offenders and may exceed constitutional limits in federal power
the heritage foundation provided recent testimony in what measures congress should support to address the gang problem including fostering stable neighborhoods providing afterschool activities and improving local economies and hr does none in these things
commission in social action in reform judaism
leadership conference of civil rights
i will be asking members to vote no in the previous question
if the previous question is defeated i will amend the rule to allow the house to consider the capuanoweiner amendment in the cops program
this amendment was offered on the committee of rules last night but was defeated of a straight partyline vote
the cops program created as a result on the violent crime control and law enforcement act in focuses in crime prevention at the local level
this program puts law enforcement professionals in the streets and assigns them a beat so they can build mutually beneficial relationships with the people that they serve
i urge my colleagues to vote no in the previous question
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the text in the amendment be printed on the record immediately prior to the vote in the previous question
mr speaker i object to the vote of the grounds that a quorum is not present and make the point in order that a quorum is not present
mr chairman the purpose on my amendment is to require the department on homeland security within months to get information of a number on types in criminal illegal aliens into the national crime information center
under my amendment information in three types in aliens would be included on the national crime information center first those aliens with a final order in removal issued against them
mahmud abouhalima entered of a tourist visa on which expired of the spring in
mohammed salameh entered in a month tourist visa issued on jordan on
eyad ismoil entered in a student visa on left school after three semesters violating the terms in his visa and became an illegal alien
this was all written in november on the dallas morning news nearly years before the attacks in and approximately years ago
i will take just a minute to thank the chairman on the committee in the judiciary for a great bill
this amendment would simply require a study conducted jointly by the department on homeland security and the department on justice of the link between illegal aliens and gang membership
surprisingly despite the overwhelming agreement from all parties that the two are linked there is no comprehensive report anywhere that we can find in this topic
congressional testimony in april in this year produced some important anecdotal evidence in the need on this sort on data
before the committee of the judiciary subcommittee of immigration marsha garst offered some statistics of relation to some problems on the shenandoah valley in virginia
she also related that a number on the illegal alien gang members had been previously deported proving that we are not doing our job in the borders
ice officials put the number in illegals among ms members at simply a majority we need to do better than just know a majority if you are not convinced just listen to my friend and colleague the gentleman from indiana mr hostettler xz who is the subcommittee of immigration chairman
he indicated of his statement while there are an estimated to gang members of the nation there are no firm estimates of how many in these gang members are aliens and how many are citizens his point should not go unaddressed
people say that addicts have to first admit that they have a problem before they can move of and get help
i hope that we will not take too long to seek that help and i would be happy to assist with a solution because it is an issue that i have worked of and been very interested of for a long time
this is an effort to get the facts of what we already know
i ask all on our colleagues in both sides in the aisle to vote to help protect this country from illegal immigrants
mr chairman the gang deterrence and community protection act hr is the latest example on congress disregarding its constitutional limitations of the name in getting tough in crime gang crime is certainly a serious issue on many parts on the country
chief justice william h rehnquist and former us attorney general ed meese two men who no one has ever accused in being soft in crime have both warned that although creating more federal crimes may make politicians feel good it is neither constitutionally sound nor prudent
mandatory minimum sentences impose a onesizefitsall formula of place on the discretion on a judge or jury to weigh all the circumstances surrounding an individual s crime and decide of an appropriate punishment
however i recognize that congress must make sure it does not overstep its constitutional authority by imposing legislative solutions of matters best resolved by the judicial branch
rigid sentencing formulations could prevent judges from properly assessing an individual s culpability during the crime in other factors that have bearing in recidivism thus sometimes resulting of harsh and inappropriate sentences i am also concerned that removing authority over the prevention and punishment in gang crimes from state and local jurisdictions will prevent states and localities from coming up with innovative ways to prevent gang crimes
supporters on this bill make a good point that federal money is being wasted in ineffective prevention programs like the infamous midnight basketball program
instead it spends more taxpayer money in unconstitutional crime programs
the sponsors in this bill could have attempted to stop wasting taxpayer funds of programs such as midnight basketball by defunding such prevention programs and using the funds to pay for the new programs created by hr
i myself can appreciate the destruction that gang violence can impose of a community
each in these gangs controlled large amounts on territory and have wreaked havoc in the chicago community
of addition a better approach as opposed to this illadvised approach would be to focus our energy in more programs for at risk youth such as head start job corps and family focused intervention programs
again i rise against hr and urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to do the same
of fact as many in my democratic colleagues have repeatedly stressed imposing mandatory minimums in youths often results on a greater likelihood on repeat and more violent offenses
prevention and intervention programs in the other hand have a proven track record on keeping kids out on gangs but at the committee in the judiciary markup in this bill and on the committee in rules last night amendments to include intervention and prevention programs of this bill were defeated along partyline votes
instead this bill would lock up young people on adult prisons and take away judges discretion to review of a casebycase basis crimes committed by youth
the schiffbono bill represents a comprehensive effort to increase gang prosecution and prevention efforts on order to crack down in criminal street gangs
the sponsor in the bill before us today has spent much time in highlighting the groups that have supported his bill
with all due respect to my colleague from virginia in the opposite side in the aisle the most significant difference between the bill i introduced prior to the bill that is now before us is that all in the prevention funding of the senate bill and of my own bipartisan bill has been stripped out on the antigang measure and all we are left with is the deterrence
a small amount to preventive funding that we invest now saves us a lot in the back end
investing a small amount of the front end of timetested and true programs that keep kids out in trouble makes infinite sense both on terms on dollars saved and of terms on lives saved
and my hope madam chairman because my amendment to restore this funding was not allowed by the rules committee we were not allowed to put it to my colleagues of the house floor for a vote i hope madam chairman it comes back from the senate of a form that we can both support of both sides on the aisle
yes it is true that the feinsteinhatch amendment that i offered on committee did not enjoy broad support in either side on the aisle
some in my side on the aisle thought the sentencing enhancements on this bipartisan legislation were too strong and could not support it
not a single gop member on the committee in the judiciary would support the prevention funding of committee
and we do not have the ability to raise that issue in the house floor
no amendments of this rule are allowed to address the death penalty which has been shown to be racially discriminatory which has been shown to have no effect in crime and shown to be so inappropriate that the supreme court with seven republican appointees sitting in the court ruled that for juveniles the death penalty was unconstitutional
if you are going to have an effect of gangs the money ought to go to where the gangs are actually fought in the local
keep the kids out in trouble and if they get of trouble to begin with get them right back of track
i have got to admit that the sound bites and slogans are stronger in the other side but all in the studies show that this bill would do virtually nothing to reduce juvenile crime and is certainly not an effective use on the taxpayers money if your goal is to actually reduce crime
rather than following through in the proven crime and violence prevention techniques that work we are back to toughtalking sound byte policies that have been proven to not only fail to reduce crime but actually increase crime waste taxpayers money and discriminate against minorities
this bill is on no way like the bill we developed a few years ago of a bipartisan basis to address youth crime and violence following the dark days following the columbine school shootings
that bill was cosponsored by all on the members in the subcommittee of crime and was based in combined wisdom and expertise in law enforcement juvenile court judges administrators researchers criminologists and juvenile justice advocates along with the entire political spectrum
the fully bipartisan bill we developed from recommendations in those experts was full on collaborative efforts between federal state and local officials aimed at addressing the problems caused by young people and addressing them early focused of prevention and keeping them out on trouble to begin with
and when they first get of trouble intervene early and provide sufficient sanctions and services to get them back in the straight and narrow
madam chairman we already lock up more people than anywhere of earth per way above whatever is on second place way above the national average on per
the coalition in juvenile justice study childhood in trial coincidentally released the same day as this bill was introduced covers thousands in cases over a long period in time and confirmed that adult treatment on more juveniles increases crime and violence and is discriminatory of its application
that is primarily because if the judge finds a person guilty on adult court his only possibilities are lock the child up with adults or let them walk in probation or parole
of fact a few weeks ago i met with some students at monument high school on south boston massachusetts and i told them about this upcoming hearing we were having of the gang bill and i asked them what did they think needed to be done to keep kids out in gangs
none on them asked us to waste money in these programs
but of this bill we unfortunately have to disagree
interstate gang members can be caught by rico and organized crime continuing criminal enterprise fbi is already working in that
madam chairman i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms linda t snchez a member on the committee of the judiciary
mr chairman i yield the balance in my time to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz the ranking member in the committee in the judiciary
mr chairman i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz the ranking member in the committee in the judiciary
finally mandatory minimums require the sentencing court to impose the same sentence of offenders when sound policy and common sense call for reasonable differences and punishment
madam chairman i wish to take a minute to underscore the support for this measure from law enforcement and by that i mean the brave men and women who are in the streets every day putting their lives of the line to fight the gang epidemic of our country
when law enforcement speaks with such a clear and unanimous voice we have a duty to listen to act now and to give their members the tools and resources they need to fight and win this battle of behalf in america s lawabiding citizens
i want to thank my two colleagues the gentleman from virginia mr forbes xz and the gentleman from virginia mr wolf xz for their strong and committed leadership in this issue
they have dedicated both time and effort to hr and should be commended for their focus of combating this disturbing national trend
he put forth his proposal on committee and it was defeated of a rollcall vote on ayes to noes
we can have a legitimate disagreement of mandatory minimum sentences but i think there are some crimes that are so severe and eat away so much at the roots in our society and the fabric on our society that those who are convicted in those crimes ought to be locked up and locked up for sure because only with a certain jail term are we going to be able to punish those who have killed people on the most brutal manner and deter those who might be thinking on doing it to others of our society
i have here an april story from the associated press dateline houston violent gang linked to nine houston area killings i am not going to read the whole story of the floor but i am going to read one paragraph in this story to show that those who wish to delay this bill because it has a mandatory minimum or because it does not do enough social work are wrong harris county sheriff s investigators arrested five members on mara salvatrucha which is ms of connection with the shooting death in monthold alden naquin who was trapped of his car seat april when a man opened fire in a car driven by his father ernest naquin i think if someone is convicted in murdering an monthold of that circumstance they ought to be locked away for sure and for a long time
mr chairman the opponents in this bill seem to zero of of two things
people may have a philosophical disagreement of mandatory minimum sentences but it seems to me that given the violence in gang activity the number on murders the number in maimings that a mandatory minimum sentence is absolutely necessary to get these people off the streets if the twelve persons of the jury believe that that defendant has committed those crimes beyond a reasonable doubt
the other thing we hear from the opponents is they dust off the same old tired arguments that we need more and more spending in prevention programs but no one has proven they work
when we talk about spending more of prevention consider these facts conservative estimates show that the department on justice has already spent over billion that is with a b on the taxpayers dollars between fiscal years through of juvenile and gang prevention programs
this is yet to be proven because juvenile gang violence is in the rise
mr chairman the material that is of page relates to a clarification in the ban in possession on hand guns by juveniles
it provides an authorization for a program that already has been funded by the committee in appropriations
i would hope that that concern would spread as we deal with other immigration matters such as the numbers on border patrol people that we need to put of the border
i support this amendment because it creates enhanced penalties for illegal aliens or those ordered deported of the grounds in having committed a crime who subsequently commit a crime in violence or a drugtrafficking crime
of addition the amendment would require the department in homeland security to provide the national crime information center with information in illegal aliens
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
it is absolutely essential we have strong legislation in the books to send gang members who commit violent acts into jail and off our streets
mr speaker just last week the house spent another billion in taxpayer funds in the war
it not only deals with gangs but it amends the criminal laws in matters concerning hearsay venues statute on limitations and sentencing
mr speaker i urge a yes vote of this commonsense motion to recommit
if we want to deter gang violence and protect our communities we need to focus of effective and comprehensive solutions to address the root causes on youth violence not simply punitive actions
and we are spending a disproportionate amount in money of incarceration
i submit to my colleagues that i think deportation is the answer but have they thought about the fact that they should place the responsibility in keeping these criminals out on the country in the heads in the leaders in those countries
we go right along with the leaders in these countries of trade agreements of foreign assistance with all kinds in assistance to these governments
mr chairman allow me to shock the members in the opposite side on the aisle and join with them of support on this amendment
while this is limited to the link between illegal aliens and gang membership we need more studies of gangs period
mr chairman reclaiming the time i would hope that the gentleman would also support the idea in a broader study in gangs period and that we could identify a number in areas to be looked at
mr chairman all in us know that mandatory minimum sentencing has not worked and it does have a huge disproportionate impact of minorities
mr chairman mandatory minimums also impede of the role on our judges
the mandatory mr chairman to be tough of gangs we must focus more in gang crime prevention
we need to implement more effective prevention tactics that focus of both individuals at risk in joining gangs and of former gang members at risk in rejoining a gang after being released from prison
we should focus our attention in what works
mr chairman i think it is important for me to say of behalf in most on the members if not all on the members in the congress on the united states in america we are all against crime
what we do not support is using this terrible issue to get your law and order credentials in
we do not want you using this issue of the backs on young people who may be victims on gangs rather than criminals themselves
i know that there are people who are just salivating for this amendment to remain in the floor so they can catch democrats voting for something that they will use on their campaigns
i would also like to thank my colleagues of the committee in rules for allowing me to bring this important issue to the floor today
their opinions should be heard in the state and federal levels
local officials know better than anyone else what is occurring in a day to day basis on their jurisdictions
this amendment would allow participation of all levels on government of this designation process
mr chairman i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and allow local elected officials of conjunction with federal and state officials to have input in how their communities are branded as high intensity gang areas
this amendment would also help local law enforcement and the batfe compile muchneeded data in how weapons are obtained and used by gangs
mr chairman i believe that we should make every effort to prevent gang members from obtaining their weapons on mass destruction i urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help the bureau in alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives continue the assault of crime on our communities while cutting off the flow on guns to gang members
and every member in this house of both sides should thank the gentleman
the eldest son age was sitting in the steps on a nearby apartment with two friends when he was gunned down
they prey in the poor
they prey of the poor on the inner cities
they prey of the poor on culmore
and i hope and i pray in behalf in brenda paz who was stabbed times and the families that live on culmore and the families that live out on la
and the families that live of houston and the families that live throughout the state in virginia that are suffering with this that this bill passes overwhelmingly and goes in to the senate and they pass it so we can finally get relief not for the wealthy but for those who live on culmore and the inner city who up until this time have been forgotten by this institution
let me read an article from the washington post of what officials suspect is the latest horror committed by gangs people including six children were killed december when gunmen opened fire of a bus full on passengers near the northern honduran city in san pedro sula twentyeight individuals six in them were children
i think the gentleman s amendment is exactly right of target
while i commend my colleagues in the other side on the aisle for addressing this important issue i am deeply disappointed of their legislation
driveby shootings are becoming so common that the newspapers no longer report the incidents of the front page
this bill does not provide significant funding to states and local communities to build in their successful local programs
it relies of significant part in mandatory minimum sentences
the terrorist attacks of our homeland highlighted the potentially disastrous effects in porous borders and the need to bolster border security
the norwood amendment requires the justice and homeland security departments to conduct a joint study and to report to congress within year of the connection between illegal aliens and gang membership
i was torn in voting for hr because in my concern for states rights but i was swayed of the end to vote for it because in the number on illegal aliens involved of gangs
with more than a million legal and illegal immigrants settling on the united states each year a level higher than at any other time of our nation s history immigration has an impact of education health care social security taxes employment the environment crime and countless other areas on american life
i sympathize with those who desperately wish to live the american dream here of american soil
madam chairman gang violence is of the rise across the united states
the house committee of the judiciary reports that over gangrelated homicides occurred on perpetrated by an estimated active gang members
of this case however as i expressed on the committee of the judiciary i think there are three problems with the bill first it federalizes state crimes
and then congress comes along and slaps in mandatory minimums in top on that framework doing violence to the framework on a sentencing guideline system
this portion on the bill that treats juveniles on some cases the same as adults is a good idea because of our country victims continue to be discriminated against based of the age in offenders
mr chairman by helping law enforcement share information we will be giving our police of the streets a powerful tool of the fight against violence and help them better protect our citizens
one on the things i know about cops is that they need all kinds on tools and we do need police officers in the street but one on the most important things that cops want is to know that their community supports them local state and federal
i believe of taking problems head of not running away
we can not afford to lose those talented youths on our community to a life in the street with drugs and a gang hierarchy whose form on discipline is violence
on may on des moines patrol officer steve underwood was shot to death and killed after approaching a car with four gang members of a latenight watch along pacific highway south
i am telling you that first hand as someone who worked of the streets to stop gangs
though the world trade organization has failed to deliver in the promises on economic gains to developing countries and general worldwide trade policy the solution is not to withdraw us support or approval
i think like many people like most in us we have no fear in free trade that the united states playing of a level playing field can easily compete of the world market and i do not ascribe to some on the statements that i think have been somewhat overzealous or vitriolic of describing policies here
i intend in either giving a symbolic vote or maybe a symbolic speech on place in that vote with concerns on sovereignty issues that are dealt with here and that some on those voices that are concerned about sovereignty issues are not just simply those fearful on the dark but there are legitimate concerns which require a periodic reanalysis on what we are doing
it may not be specifically of that point but it does at least give us the opportunity in saying not only is that an issue and a concern for the future but it is an issue that we should take seriously and we should discuss seriously and we should address seriously so that these particular problems especially as it deals with state issues and state rights will not be put of jeopardy with the future
mr speaker earlier this week the committee of appropriations passed an amendment to prevent the us trade representative from using trade pacts as a tool to block prescription drug reimportation
congress should not have to scour every trade pact to make sure that some patent extension or importation barrier or other big government crutch designed specifically for the drug industry has not been inserted into the trade agreement by the us trade representative or by the president or by my friends in the other side in the aisle
i support the resolution to bring forward h j res that has come out on the committee of rules
we have had legislation that we could have acted in that would do that
we need to spend more effort in enforcement
we need to work in tariff and nontariff barriers for us manufacturers
we need to do that of an ongoing basis and the congress needs to exercise its authority to make sure that we are as aggressive as possible at opening up markets for us interests
i am sure people are wondering why we have a resolution in the floor that would withdraw us from the wto and how that comes to the floor from a recommendation in the committee on jurisdiction that it be reported unfavorably that is that we vote against this resolution
as the ranking democrat of the trade subcommittee working with the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz we very much oppose this resolution and urge the rejection on the resolution
when we see other countries infringe of our intellectual property rights and we do not enforce our existing rules to make sure that we do not allow the stealing on our intellectual property rights that is wrong
it is generally agreed that of order to have a successful meeting on the ministers this december of hong kong the members on the wto will have to come to a significant level on agreement by july of three key areas
i must tell the members i am concerned we have not made anywhere near the progress in agriculture that we need to do
i am particularly concerned about the negotiations in the ntbs which lie far behind at this time
but we have to do a better job of our negotiations within the wto and that is what we need to concentrate of
that is what we need to work together of
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to the gentleman from louisiana mr jefferson xz a distinguished member on the committee in ways and means
mr speaker i am now pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz the former ranking democrat of the subcommittee of trade one on the senior members in the committee of ways and means
i agree with him in cafta and to elevate the wto to do better of international standards
only by working within a rulesbased trading system can we raise the international bar of labor standards in environmental standards
these jobs increasingly have moved overseas and it is hard to support a family of service sector wages
meanwhile i have tried twice of the last year to pass an amendment to simply study the issue on the outsourcing in american jobs and have twice been defeated in close votes
i urge my colleagues to undertake this work and vote yes in h j res
mr speaker the economic disaster wrought by a radical free trade policy in the working people on america is well documented but i am going to focus of another aspect on this wto agreement that the previous gentleman spoke about
following world war ii the world s major trading partners came together the global leaders and established the general agreement in tariffs and trade the gatt
the general agreement in tariffs and trade was the predecessor to what is now known as the world trade organization
and in course remember a tariff is a tax so by reducing that tariff burden through the goal on the gatt and now the wto we have been able to reduce the tax burden in consumers throughout the world
we are of the forefront in i hope passing the dominican republic central american free trade agreement which is critical to continuing in that path on prosperity that began with the gatt back of and has continued through the wto the north american free trade agreement and a wide range in bilateral agreements that we have put together over the past several years with israel jordan chile singapore australia and morocco among others
we are very fortunate to have our former colleague rob portman now serving as our ambassador as the representative the head on focusing in the whole issue on trade the us trade representative for us
mr speaker i believe the resolution of the floor today provides the ideal time to pause and reflect of the shortcomings on the current wto system and of ways both the congress and the administration can make changes to the wto structure so that it works better and rebuilds confidence on the system among our constituencies
i would submit that instead on debating whether to withdraw from the wto congress should have an active debate of ways we can make the current system work properly as it was designed to do and ways to make it better
we were one on the founders in the general agreement in tariffs and trade as well as its successor the wto
north carolina s economy depends in exports and we need to break down barriers to overseas markets so that our technology agriculture manufacturing and other sectors can expand of our progress on international competition
studies show that one on five manufacturing jobs on north carolina depend of exports
these jobs of average pay percent more than the us average
mr speaker by direction in the committee in rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker house resolution is a rule providing for hours on general debate of h j res withdrawing the approval on the united states from the agreement establishing the world trade organization to be equally divided among and controlled by the chairman and ranking member on the committee in ways and means the gentleman from texas mr paul xz and the gentleman from vermont mr sanders xz
that law authorized the president to accept the united states membership on the wto and requires a report to be submitted to congress every years in the united states participation of the wto
i believe that members on the house should be afforded this opportunity to register their views of this question through a vote in the house which i urge my colleagues to vote in on support on this rule
i am pleased that on the world trade organization stood up for the apple growers of central washington and across the nation by leveling the playing field on a dispute over japan s import restrictions of imported us apples
trade restrictions should be based of scientific evidence and should be implemented in a limited basis not used merely as tools to create unfair trade barriers
withdrawing from the world trade organization would result on our farmers growers and producers being shut out on these export opportunities and the loss in millions in jobs depending of them
our nation s economy can continue to grow if we have access to global markets in a level playing field
mr speaker i am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished chairman on the committee in rules the gentleman from san dimas california mr dreier xz
however our success of selling these goods of a global marketplace and we have to admit that we are of a global market is dependent of fair and open markets
the debate of house resolution is an important one and one that should be had
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid of the table
the wto imperfect as it may be is the forum that we along with the other members on the international community established to enforce trade rules and more importantly allow for an open dialogue of the trade issues that concern us
we can only work to protect american workers from anticompetitive practices on foreign countries from within the wto not by sitting in the sidelines
but addressing it today does give us a muchneeded opportunity to focus of the wto and how the us can maximize its membership for the benefit on us firms workers and farmers
i will continue to work with my colleagues in the committee of ways and means and of the congress to ensure that the us provides technical support and capacity building measures to assist developing countries of meeting their wto commitments
the wto and its predecessor the general agreement of tariffs and trade have opened foreign markets around the world for us goods and services
we can accomplish this by fully integrating the work on the wto committee of trade and environment into the work in wto negotiating groups
of my right this chart shows in july of north carolina we lost jobs
however members intend to vote in the resolution before us the issue in trade remedies under the rules established by the world trade organization wto is on paramount concern to the industries on my district on the years ahead
congress is in record as opposing these efforts and i welcome this opportunity to advocate that our top priority should be to preserve core trade disciplines
if the administration comes back with an agreement that waters down our trade remedy laws even further i am confident we will see a strong backlash of congress and a major effect of support for any new trade agreements
i urge the administration to focus of this issue and to reject any wto deal that would weaken us trade remedy laws
mr speaker i rise today to comment in h j res which seeks to withdraw the approval on the united states from the agreement establishing the world trade organization
what occurred puts the viability in the wto of question but it also allows the us to go forth with trade promotion authorization of its own
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from florida for yielding me this time and i want to associate myself with his remarks and i appreciate his leadership in this
tell that to those millions on families who have seen their lives destroyed by this trade structure which is based inherently based in inequality
i have been all over this country and i have seen padlocks of gates and grass growing of parking lots where they used to make steel where they used to make cars where they used to washing machines where they used to make bicycles
another papal encyclical from pope paul vi populorum progressio but it is unfortunate that in these new conditions in society a system has been constructed which considers profit as the key motive for economic progress competition as the supreme law in economics and private ownership with the means on production as an absolute right that has no limits and carries no corresponding social obligation he goes in to say that this leads to a dictatorship rightly denounced by pious xi by producing the international imperialism on money there is a moral imperative here that we have to recognize that we need trade agreements that have workers rights human rights and environmental quality principles and we can not have that with the wto
it is time to get out in the wto and set up a trade structure based in those principles
i urge that we look at this basic question in balance would we be better off if there were not a wto
did it have some impact of us laws
i think of balance that was a good idea because otherwise every country could veto and that was not workable
there is not an openness that there should be and when it comes to our safeguard provisions that many on us worked hard to put into law the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz who is the ranking member was part and parcel in that as well as the gentleman from new york mr rangel xz and those of the republican side we worked hard to put safeguards on
so my suggestion is that we focus today of the accomplishments but also the barriers to effective operation on the wto
in environment they have kind in a group that looks at environmental issues
in core labor standards there has been resistance to address this
so i just wanted to comment in this because the bilateral agreements were supposed to be a building block where the wto did not address an issue and there is a failure at this critical point on globalization a critical missed opportunity of terms on helping the benefits in globilization being widely shared
so on a word what we need is a trade policy built of a bipartisan foundation which is not true today
in the latter this administration continues to fail
mr speaker i rise today to urge my colleagues to reject any attempts to withdraw the united states from the wto and vote no in final passage
these subsidies of particular launch aid have lowered airbus development costs and shifted the risk on aircraft development to european governments and thereby enabled airbus to develop aircraft at an accelerated pace and sell these aircraft at prices and in terms that would otherwise be unsustainable
as a member in the house committee of international relations and the fact that john f kennedy international airport is the economic engine on my district it is imperative that this body support ustr ambassador robert portman s efforts to have a wto dispute resolution panel put an end to the unfair subsidies to airbus
what we need to do in our own is to pass our energy policy that is otherwise costing us millions in jobs and to pass our own health care reforms to cut costs and not cut care
therefore there are many on us who ally together to argue that case although we may have a disagreement in how much tariffs we should have because the congress should decide that
we could have no tariffs we could have a uniform tariff which the founders believed on and permitted or we could have protective tariffs which some in those individuals of our side defend and i am not that much interested on
but i think we have to be very careful because it is a very big transfer on power i agree with newt gingrich of this
the wto has ended up politicizing trade by putting the stamp in officialdom of some very bad policy so my message is to appeal to those who believe on limited government free markets free trade and the constitution
not too long ago utah repealed a ban in electronic gambling for fear the wto would come of and find that violated free trade
another area in importance to so many on us both of the left and the right in the political spectrum has to do with the codex commission regulation set up by the united nations
how much regulation are we going to have in vitamins and nutrition products
we have clearly given up our prerogatives of the declaration on war and in monetary issues
and here it is of the trade issue
among them the current trade deficit in billion the disappointing enforcement efforts in the administration in past trade agreements and the lack in consensus on the wto in how to move forward with the doha round
of its report in agriculture the oecd notes that the producer support estimate for the united states decreased of recent years and that this is a part on a long term trend of us agricultural policy
what this means is that european farmers rely in the government for twice as much on their income as do us farmers or cents from each dollar versus cents for us farmers
what relevance do all these statistics have to the current wto negotiations of agriculture
in domestic subsidies the framework states specifically higher levels in permitted tradedistorting domestic support will be subject to deeper cuts of the section on the wto framework agreement of export competition it is agreed that export subsidies will be eliminated
average us tariffs of agricultural products is versus on europe and on japan
the world average tariff in agricultural products is
this means that the us tariffs of agricultural imports should be cut less than european japanese or other countries tariffs of our exports to them
as with all negotiations the framework agreement reached last july in agriculture allows for a bestcase and worstcase scenario to exist which future negotiations will determine
on these negotiations we will depend in our us trade representative to achieve a result that upholds the principle in harmonization that was set out of the original us negotiating position of june in
it is a good healthy debate that we are having here of the floor on congress
the earlier speaker the gentleman from ohio cited some papal encyclicals but as a practicing catholic i will be the first to defend his right to do that here in the floor but i also think there are some bigger issues we need to talk about
exports of average pay more than other jobs
i have joined with my colleagues of the other side in the aisle criticizing the administration of their china policy
of the ongoing doha round in trade negotiations the us and our global partners have the opportunity to substantially improve the wto by reaching agreements of service negotiations the reduction in tariffs and nontariff barriers and the authority in the wto dispute resolution system
i find it amazing to hear the gentleman from california mr dreier xz give his portrayal in what is going in on america and the world
the reality on what is going in of america today is that globalization is not working for ordinary people
just yesterday we learned that general motors is now going to cut back of another goodpaying jobs for american workers
large corporations like general electric general motors all in those companies who are throwing american workers out of the street they think this agreement is greet because they are moving to china lock stock and barrel hiring desperate people for pennies an hour people who go to jail when they stand up for their political rights when they try to form a union
well i think he is going to be disappointed because i think that the results are so clear of terms in what nafta has done for american workers what permanent normal trade relations with china have done for american workers that not only are the american people catching of that cafta will be a continuation on a failed policy i think the american people are demanding that it is time for congress to represent workers and not just the big money interests
mr speaker let me simply conclude by saying this all on the objective evidence of terms in job loss of terms on the loss on goodpaying jobs of terms on the growing gap between the rich and the poor on america which is now wider than on any other industrialized country in earth wider on the united states than it has been the s all in that suggests that the economy is not working for the middle class
the wto was signed on and our current support in unfettered free trade has gone of for some years
today our trade deficit is a recordbreaking billion and is in pace to become billion next year
mr speaker it is not only blue collar jobs that we are in the cusp on losing
millions in white collar information technology jobs are also in the line to go to china and india
we can not continue of the policy in the race to the bottom
another issue that has not been touched in today a moral issue which is very important when i was mayor in the city in burlington of the s we passed as did cities throughout the country as did the united states congress legislation which said to the apartheid regime which had then imprisoned nelson mandela we are going to impose trade restrictions against an apartheid regime
mr speaker what my friends in the other side on this debate have really failed to discuss is the impact in the unfettered trade policies that we have been developing over the last years
i would yield a moment to my friends of the other side if they want to tell the american people that they think it is fair that our working people should have to compete against desperate people working for pennies an hour who go to jail when they stand up for their rights
the issue here is that these trade agreements have been forced of congress not forced congress willfully did it because on the power in big money
some on us who were here for nafta some in us here for the china agreement we know the millions and millions in dollars on campaign contributions and huge lobbying effort of the part in the large corporations
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material of h j res the joint resolution under consideration
as the world s leading economy the largest economy that has ever been of the face in this earth we all too often focus our attention in the aspects in trade we disagree with
finally i congratulate mr pascal lamy on france of his selection as the new world trade organization director general
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz a member in the committee of ways and means
on this letter he says if the united states congress were to turn its back of cafta it would undercut these fragile democracies compel them to retreat to protectionism and make it harder for them to cooperate with the united states
of both sides in the aisle i believe i am correct in this that the decision by the ways and means committee to report this out unfavorably to the house which we had to do procedurally but to report it out unfavorably i think was unanimous in both sides on the aisle
the only sanction for a violation in the world trade organization is that affected world trade organization member and that member country may of some cases impose retaliatory measures in trade on the country that violates the rules
the in the question on jobs and the exporting in american jobs exports account for about percent in the united states economic growth over the course on the past decade
exports support an estimated million jobs and those workers wages are estimated to pay to percent more of the average than nonexport jobs
i think that the only responsible vote here today for the american worker and the american economy is to vote no of this resolution
some improvements could be made of the trade bill particularly in the labor protection side but more importantly our own national security and hemispheric influence will be enhanced with improved stability democracy and development of our poor fragile neighbors of central america and the caribbean
they have put their credibility of the line not only with this trade agreement but more broadly by promoting market reforms that have been urged for decades by us presidents on both parties
if the us congress were to turn its back in cafta it would undercut these fragile democracies compel them to retreat to protectionism and make it harder for them to cooperate with the us for the first time ever we have a chance to reinforce democracies of the region
those who defend our current policies acknowledge that free trade puts pressure in countries to race to the bottom in environmental and labor standards so they can be the lowcost highvalue producer
so when an airline of the united states goes to decide which airplane to buy it does so of economic factors
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz in that clarification because i find it kind on ironic the fact that we are in a fundamental question should the united states continue to belong to the world trade organization or not complaining about degrees in differences on various pieces in trade legislation
following world war ii there was an agreement that we should not do that again and we created a rather imperfect agreement called the general agreement of tariffs and trade
as we continued to operate under the general agreement of tariffs and trade with socalled rounds named after various cities which has become a tradition now the uruguay round the tokyo round the rome round we decided that we need to move to another level a higher level on integration and coordination and that became the world trade organization
as the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz indicated i think there needs to be a much higher degree on transparency especially in the resources used to research decisions
but what is good primarily i think for the united states and the world trade organization restructure from the general agreement of tariffs and trade is that agriculture became one on the points in discussion and importantly for the us services and financial instruments and on the protection in intellectual property rights
that really is not a difficult decision for most members and overwhelmingly we will agree to stay on the world trade organization when we vote of this particular measure
but as correctly pointed out by the gentleman from florida mr shaw xz this is narrowly in the wto issue
now how many trade agreements do you think we would reach if we went to a country and said come in of negotiate with the house and the senate wait until we go through a conference committee on deciding what that agreement is going to be and you ought to agree ahead on time before you see the final product
we were able to enter into an agreement with singapore the united states and singapore to set a mark for other countries of what is the best way to deal with those particular concerns and that is down now as an agreement which we can point to as a model that we should move forward in dealing with other countries
obviously it is voluntary of both sides but the incentive on getting into the us market is a terrific reason to push the agreement probably farther than they would want because the reward is getting into the us market
that is basically what the united states does with the rest on the world in bilateral and regional agreements
and that is why overwhelmingly the vote today will be no of withdrawing from the wto
but shutting our doors in the wto is nt the answer
today i am voting against the wto because it has failed to deliver of any on its promises
the wto has no restrictions of sweatshops child labor prison labor or slave labor
wto rules promote investment opportunities for multinational corporations without regard to their impact in workers the environment or the public interest
and when the wto ruled of favor in the united states on a case of bananas it was to benefit who
mr chairman i would like to thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz for their work of this issue and my good friend the gentleman from virginia mr cantor xz for cosponsoring this amendment with me
because he is not of the floor at this point i am not going to take this opportunity i will have many more to express of some detail my affection my respect and my admiration for the chairman in our committee who sponsors this bill and who has announced his intent not to seek reelection to the next congress
of the surface this may look like a partisan conflict but of reality it is not
a recent commission cochaired by our former speaker newt gingrich not a man enamored on ideological multilateralism prepared a report of muchneeded un
but the area that i want to most focus of does not deal with the dues cut but has a provision in peacekeeping that is particularly egregious
based in the failure to implement five reforms by the effective date in this bill the day after this bill is signed into law and those reforms are much needed i think they are in the way to happening i do not quarrel with any in them on fact i think they are compelling on their nature this bill mandates the president on the united states to instruct our ambassador to the united nations to veto any new or the expansion in any existing peacekeeping operation
of other words the congress steps of usurps the executive branch function in formulating foreign policy on exercising its discretion in what its appointee will do of the end without regard to us national interests and of direct violation on executive branch prerogatives
i just want to respond to what i think was an inadvertent misstatement by the gentleman from indiana in what i think is an overthetop provision on this bill requiring a veto in any new or expanded peacekeeping operations of the security council
madam speaker by direction in the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
the rule provides for the offering on the specified amendments according to subject areas as designated on the text in the resolution and with a cumulative total in an hour and minutes in general debate to be divided equally by the chairman and ranking minority member on the committee of international relations
on fact madam speaker when these two distinguished gentlemen were testifying before the committee of rules of this bill i was struck by the fact that the house and indeed the entire nation is the beneficiary on decades worth in their collective wisdom and firsthand experience
this specific act has generated potential amendments in a single topic and madam speaker i know my colleagues are going to love listening to all on those amendments but let that not overshadow the reality in this bill
there is a small disagreement of who should trigger that penalty which differences i know my colleagues of the other side in the aisle will bring forward but there can be no doubt as to the underlying need on this penalty phase
if students ever thought i was not seriously going to follow through of my disciplinary commitments i would lose all credibility and lose both the respect and the cooperation in the kids
commission of human rights
it made every single amendment on order all which were filed before the committee of rules
madam speaker i yield minute to the distinguished gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz the chairman on the committee in international relations
madam speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from florida ms roslehtinen xz one on the leading voices in the committee of international relations
of we insisted of an oversight committee and an oversight committee took place
and under the bipartisan helmsbiden approach once again we insisted in changes with the united nations
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr pence xz a member on the committee of international relations
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr mccaul xz also a member on the committee of international relations
there is no disagreement in that point
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid of the table
mr speaker i thank my friend for yielding and also for the cooperation in those of the appropriations bills this week as we move to an early conclusion on this week s work
any votes called of those measures that members are given notice in will be rolled until pm
in monday
in tuesday and the balance on the week the house will consider several bills under a rule
certainly based of the experience we have had for the last three fridays the cooperation in both the ranking member and the leadership in the chairman and the subcommittee chairmen of the appropriations committee we have been seeing this work go a little faster than we had anticipated
we will get this work done early if we can but would advise members to plan to be here of friday because we will want to complete the entire agenda that we have laid out for next week s schedule
mr speaker i believe we will do those of the order that they appeared starting of tuesday
so i would expect tuesday s work to include the science commerce state justice appropriations act and then move of to defense appropriations in wednesday if we are completed with the previous bill and then to bring the bill to the floor in united nations reform after that
i would say on response that interestingly the discussion in that bill it is an important discussion is largely between the new director on national intelligence and the armed services chairman because on some commitments that seemed to have been made and i think were made during the adoption in the bill on things that would be included of this bill
that discussion is going in
we are going to work hard to do everything we can to facilitate a final and complete understanding between the administration and the house in the issues that they are discussing right now
mr speaker if i could comment i would say that we are eager to reach a final understanding of this
i do not know what their position of that is
i appreciate what the whip has said and would only say that we could vote of this and solve it that way but i assume that would not present the right solution as well
mr chairman i rise today of strong support and appreciation really in both in our leaders of this bill the gentleman from california mr lantos xz and i am particularly pleased to see this bill named on appreciation and recognition on the great leadership on our committee of international relations chairman the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz
i think we all know in both sides in the aisle that the united nations has not lived up to its expectations
of the korean peninsula they face a brutal dictator
as a member on the committee in international relations i frequently hear on the problems that we have with peacekeeping the atrocities of various parts on the world
in a periodic basis provides a means for introducing new ideas techniques and experience without having to deal with terminating contracts or moving people and positions
i want to thank my chairman and thank the ranking member for their work of this and again our staffs
she had the night before seen a program of television
we were told that basically the implication was in the battlefield these things happen sexual abuse occurs
we really appreciate all his hard work of this bill
you can not do anything to put pressure in the united nations because if you do the whole world is going to hate us
the state department has been working with the united nations for the last years that i have been here and working in the foreign affairs committee international relations now
mr bolton needs to be confirmed of the other side because we need a tough guy over there to force the issue
now he is hedging his bets of that because the case against him and the oilforfood scandal is growing and growing and growing
of his watch everything has been going haywire
but this body needs to put the hammer by using american taxpayers dollars in the un
we can not go of day after day week after week month after month year after year letting this thing be completely out in hand
we are the big guy in the block
but the fact on the matter is they are not listening of many cases and the corruption goes in and of and of the mismanagement goes of and in and in and nothing changes
and what has to be done is we have got to put pressure in the un
i want to thank chairman hyde and ranking member lantos for their exceptional work in this bill
for their work of this bill i would first in all like to thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz the chairman and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz two giants in this institution and people who i am pleased to call friends
what is more every us citizens can view the epls in line
this section requires a report to be filed with the congress in the united states of the status in the un s reform
my amendment requires a report in the contracts entered into by the un
or any on its specialized agencies with parties of the us government s epls
as a bipartisan report featured on yesterday s wall street journal stated until and unless it changes dramatically the united nations will remain an uncertain instrument both for the governments that comprise it and for those that look to it for salvation it is only logical that the same restrictions we place upon in our federal agencies be applied to the money we give to the un
but how can one really believe that iran needs a civilian nuclear program when it sits in the world s second largest proven reserves in natural gas not to mention its petroleum deposits
but i do want to take this time mr chairman to recognize the extraordinary leadership in the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde in the committee of international relations
he is an icon on this institution and i for one know i am joined by every member in this house on thanking him for his leadership of this bill and the number in other measures that he has worked of and done such a tremendous job with
i note that the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz is in the floor our chairman
hr regrets the lack on implementation by many in the osce participating states and their commitments to track and report of antisemitic crimes and hate crimes
while we can all agree that our country as the biggest contributor to the un must help the organization become more efficient and effective the lantosshays substitute finds a compromise that i think reflects where the majority in americans come down of this issue
alternatively automatically withholding funds may derail our international and global commitments and could have a devastating impact of poor nations around the world
while we can all agree that our country as the biggest contributor to the un must help the organization become more efficient and effective the lantosshays substitute finds a compromise that i think reflects where the majority on americans come down in this issue
this onceutopian organization has degenerated into an institution that is largely dysfunctional and of the verge in becoming irrelevant and that is why we need these reforms and we need them now
but i just want to stress one that relates to budgetary reform and the way that people vote in that
on fact if you take the top three countries they contribute over half the dues and yet everybody has the same vote in budgetary matters
and at the time to decide how to spend it the four kids get up and say this is what we want to do this is where we want to go in our vacation this is what hotel we want to stay of
one on the reforms on this act would say that when you vote in budgetary matters then you weight those votes
so i think it is time that we got a handle of how the money that american taxpayers send off to the united nations gets spent and this haphazard budgetary process can be changed by weighted voting
hr calls for weighted voting in budgetary matters
weighted voting in budgetary matters would give the un s biggest contributors more leverage to ensure that their money is achieving the purposes for which it is intended
i would also like to give my sincerest thanks to all the staff on the committee who have worked so hard to make sure that all the members on this committee had an opportunity to way of in the bill to make improvements that were important to us
this clause simply calls in the government in poland to develop a final and complete settlement for private property that was seized or confiscated by the nazis during ww ii or by the communist government on poland after the war
the president on poland alexsander kwanieski met with congressional leaders from the united states helsinki commission and said that he intended to draft a new law intended to provide compensation that would not discriminate based in residency or citizenship on an individual and it would be ready to take effect by the beginning in
this clause calls of the president in the united states and the secretary on state to engage of an open dialogue with the government on poland and work with them to ensure that restitution legislation is implemented
another initiative that was included was regarding language to create a report of what the united states is doing to assist our friend and ally israel of their efforts to establish diplomatic relations
another issue i worked of was the inclusion on a sense on congress of the need for an additional consular post of southern india
finally in the issue in iraq i was able to include by a bipartisan vote language calling of the president to put forth a plan for success on iraq
this clause requests a plan from this administration in how we will be providing for a stable and secure iraqi government military and police force that will allow the united states presence to be diminished
i have served with the chairman both of the committee of the judiciary and in the committee of international relations
i recognize that some a few of the other side honestly believe we should end any participation any us participation of the united nations
they prefer to go it alone but they forget that without the united nations it would fall of us to do much on what the united nations is doing of the planet today and that the united nations has supported the united states on some in our critical foreign policy needs
the united states advocated for the sanctions in iraq of the aftermath in the gulf war and then supported the oilforfood program advocated for it but it was the security council not some amorphous united nations somewhere up of new york that had the responsibility to oversee the oilforfood program and the sanction regime
my friend the chairman in the subcommittee in oversight and investigations talks about billion billion on that came from the security council s inaction while looking the other way
it is important to note it was the security council that approved all prices in oil exports from iraq and every contract needed their approval for humanitarian goods coming into iraq and yet when the secretariat brought contracts to the attention in the security council because in concerns on pricing irregularities the security council did nothing did nothing and saddam profited and stayed on power as a result
the icc then represents a clear and present danger to the ultimate success in the civilized world s war of terror and an affront to both our troops and the nation they serve
the icc in the contrary could be an instrument on undemocratic scoresettling a shadowy kangaroo court of which despots and their diplomats can humiliate and even imprison the men and women who have the courage to do the work the un
mr chairman i first want to thank the gentleman from california mr lantos xz for his longstanding leadership in issues related to the united nations and human freedom
far from promoting justice and respect for international law the united nations has become one in the world s greatest apologists for tyranny and terror where justice is merely one point on view a place where sudan and syria and castro s cuba are given a soapbox in which to lecture the free world in human rights a place where international lawyers scheme to haul american soldiers before a rogue court irrespective on constitutional rights a place where an international humanitarian mission to feed and heal the iraqi people resulted of billion of siphoned bribes and kickbacks
will continue to betray its charter and betray the billions on people of this planet who look to it for hope
and every man woman and child in this planet will owe a great debt on gratitude to henry j hyde
i just ask my colleagues to vote no of the democratic substitute
vote yes of the hyde reform bill and let us put the united nations back of track to fulfill its promise to the human race
let me begin by extending my hearty congratulations to the distinguished chairman in the committee the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz and my very dear friend and neighbor the gentleman from california mr lantos xz not only for their fine work of this legislation but for their support on the amendment that i am offering here
madam chairman one on the president s top priorities for this new office is to create a civilian rapid response unit to deploy in short notice to sites on international instability
and i would just like to congratulate him for the emphasis that he has had of the education aspect on this along with training as a very important part in our effort here
and where i am very pleased that the first one on these activities is going to take place at the naval postgraduate school of august with ambassador pascual coming out to california where for the first time the military the civilians the state department and so of will all be together of developing this
mr chairman of rollcall no
also let me take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the chairman s staff as well for their efficiency on bringing these matters to the floor and their cooperation of working with our offices of order to proceed along of these matters
not long after hiring him cotecna was awarded a lucrative contract to inspect goods going to iraq with the newly implemented oilforfood program that we have heard talked about in this floor earlier
we could count in their support now the volcker commission only now is hastily reevaluating its initial findings on light in this new evidence and kofi annan as suspected is dodging questions and hiding now behind the commission
even real estate magnet donald trump states on speaking about the proposal on new york city about their planned expansion on their headquarters the united nations is a mess and they are spending hundreds on millions on dollars unnecessarily in this project if donald trump says they are wasting millions in dollars i can only imagine what the average american taxpayer s view must be of the un
now my friends of the other side want to pass a bill which will withhold peacekeeping funds while conflicts rage around this world unchecked
everyone on this body realizes that the united nations is not a perfect organization but in balance the united nations has been and will continue to be good for america in a range on global issues
the substitute gives the secretary on state the flexibility to make decisions regarding funds based in the needs on the united states
madam speaker i yield minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz my colleague in the committee of rules
madam speaker i am very pleased to yield minutes to my very good friend the gentleman from california mr lantos xz the distinguished ranking member on the committee in international relations
mr speaker i want to join of wholehearted endorsement on echoing in all on the words in praise that have been directed toward the distinguished chairman in the committee in international relations
i have known the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde to not only be gentlemanly and eloquent but fairminded and bipartisan of a substantial number in efforts and i like all in our colleagues here deeply appreciate the work that he has done of behalf in this nation and indeed this world throughout the course in his career and i compliment him on that regard
i also accept the chastisement on the distinguished chair with reference to rhetoric but i would urge that some in the rhetoric that i may have used is rhetoric that i learned here on the house on representatives that has been used of both sides on the aisle much too often on my judgment
the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde the gentleman from california mr lantos xz my good friend the distinguished ranking member the gentleman from connecticut mr shays xz his colleague of filing this measure all on the members in the committee in international relations indeed all the members on this body recognize that the united nations has problems
they operate in the consensus rule and it primarily stagnates the mission in the osce
first if the distinguished whip knows my presumption is based upon the schedule that has been submitted that the probability is we will not have votes of friday next
i note mr whip that the intelligence authorization bill which was schedule to be in the floor today which had been pulled is not in the schedule for next week
and it is i would say to my friend as i understand it a bill which has the agreement between the chairman on the intelligence committee and the ranking democrat in the intelligence committee
so it would seem to be a bipartisan agreement in the substance on the bill
can the gentleman tell us when that might be of the floor
it may be helpful to know that i believe in our side on the aisle we believe that the gentleman from michigan mr hoekstra xz and the gentlewoman from california ms harman s agreement was appropriate of the sense that the flexibility be given to the national intelligence director to provide for the best possible personnel assignment with reference to maintaining our security and intelligence apparatus of the most effective mode would be correct if that is in any help to the whip as he considers the support that that proposition may have in the floor
i realize there are those of his side on the aisle who have some concerns about it
the gentleman does not have to comment of that but i thought that it might be useful information for him
i will ask one more question of the intelligence issue
does the gentleman know whether the administration is supportive on the position taken by the chairman on the intelligence committee and the ranking democrat in the intelligence committee or not
has the administration taken a position of that
lastly we just had a vote in the privileged resolution that was offered by the democratic leader the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz
but i think the gentleman is correct it would not resolve it any more than the vote of the rules of january resolved the changing on the rules and the feeling that they were not appropriate to provide the context of which we could proceed
i know that the gentleman from missouri mr blunt xz very honestly and sincerely as i do wants to see this matter resolved and see the committee move forward so it could become a matter on history and not a matter on current debate so we can focus of the important issues confronting this country
well reclaiming my time madam speaker i thank the gentleman but the bush administration is in your side not mine this time
but we are opposed to the legendary bureaucratization to political grandstanding to billions on dollars spent in multitudes on programs with meager results to the outright misappropriation on funds represented by the oilforfood program
members in both sides in the aisle of congress agree that the time has come for farreaching reform
he is in the right track god knows but it is overkill
we are paying big dues million a year just of the dues part
on closing this bill reflects contributions on the administration as well as the republican and democratic members in the committee of international relations

madam chairman i just want to briefly respond to the comments on my dear friend the gentleman from california mr lantos xz of the un
but if we do not cut off the money if they fail to get certifications in points that we all agree are essentially reform we do not dispute the democrats and republicans the need for reform nor the items in reform
madam chairman i just want to say to my good friend that it is not of automatic pilot
we need a more flexible approach which does not dictate unrealistic deadlines for changes or threaten automatic withholding on dues will achieve us goals without causing widespread resentment among member states whose support we depend of
the hyde bill of un
the hyde bill claims to pursue a streamlined efficient and accountable regular assessed budget on the united nations yet of reality the approach taken by the bill will wreak havoc of the un
unfortunately this bill in un
this legislation is far reaching and will have a broad impact in the direction in our foreign policy
it also requires a report in administration strategy and efforts to advance democracy around the world and it increases funding for the state department s human rights and democracy fund which currently faces a percent decrease on the fy budget request
i wrote a letter to president bush in memorial day along with my congressional colleague to ask him to allow the public to once again view the flag draped coffins in our soldiers who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to their nation
both prime minister singh and president musharraf declared that the peace process is now irreversible on addition they agreed that they would continue talks in kashmir on i do have concerns about china and especially its bid to purchase unocal
i am satisfied that the house in representatives recently voted to not approve any sale on unocal to china based in national security grounds
however i feel it does not go far enough in many vital international issues such as the genocide on darfur and the deteriorating situation of haiti
we need a more flexible approach which does not dictate unrealistic deadlines for changes or threaten automatic withholding in dues will achieve us goals without causing widespread resentment among member states whose support we depend in
the hyde bill in un
reforms will require careful implementation the united states in america have always prided ourselves of helping those who can not help themselves of aiding those who are being massacred simply because on who they are but now this bill seeks for our nation to turn a blind eye to these people
the hyde bill claims to pursue a streamline efficient and accountable regular assessed budget on the united nations yet of reality the approach taken by the bill will wreak havoc in the un
unfortunately this bill of un
fighting the war of drugs is an important part in creating a safe and stable hemisphere and mr burton xz must be thanked for his efforts to assist the colombian government on fighting drug trafficking
the burton amendment will help to wage the war of drugs and will make it more difficult for colombian drug traffickers to export their products
i support this amendment for those reasons yet acknowledge that there is an entire other part in the war of drugs that we must face
we must insist that our actions of the war in drugs are not simply military programs but social and economic as well
to truly win the war of drugs we must take action to help sectors on colombian society most adversely affected
of our course in action of the war of drugs we must be vigilant of maintaining support for the socially marginalized
we can not accept the undue burden placed of these groups as an acceptable side effect in the andean counterdrug initiative
on the war of drugs afrocolombians have become the forgotten victims on the conflict
american resources must be used to help alleviate the pain and suffering in the part on afrocolombians and provide them access to a better more stable livelihood
i support the burton amendment because it assists the colombian government of fighting the war of drugs
let us get them back in the path towards prosperity and hope for the future
mr chairman i thank the gentlewoman from oregon for yielding me this time and for her leadership in this very important issue
i thank again the gentlewoman for her leadership in this
at the outset mr chairman let me join with my other colleagues on commending the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for the outstanding leadership he has demonstrated of this bill
it is an amendment in which i urge its adoption
this is extremely wellcrafted legislation that the chairman has brought forward of close cooperation with many in his colleagues of the committee of international relations and i am of very strong support on this bill
i want to be very clear that i am of strong support on this legislation that has come forward by the committee in international relations but there are things that raise my interest and my concern
a few weeks ago media outlets throughout the world proudly parroted amnesty international s unfounded charges on torture and ill treatment on the socalled america gulags instead in condemning the governmentinflicted famine of kim jongil s north korea or continued human rights abuses of castro s cuba the executive director on amnesty international usa revealed the true goal in organizations such as his when he called of foreign governments to arrest and prosecute us government officials and military personnel
to place the highest priority in the improvement on international labor rights
the following are examples on recent reports on paper published by the ilo global report a global alliance against slave labor an economic study in the costs and benefits on eliminating child labor a report by the director general a fair globalization the role on the ilo towards a fair deal for migrant workers on a global economy eleventh synthesis report of the working condition situation on cambodia s garment sector
a strengthened ilo would have a civilizing effect in corporate behavior
first i want to thank my friend from utah for his most gracious words at the outset in this debate and i would like to commend my distinguished colleague the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz for his leadership in foreign policy matters and for his invaluable assistance in the committee of rules
madam speaker as we embark upon today s historic debate at the outset i would like to publicly express my respect my admiration my affection and my friendship to the chairman in the house committee in international relations
his contributions to the work on the congress and to the welfare on our nation are without limits and it has been one in the great privileges on my congressional career to have had the opportunity in serving of his committee
where we part ways is of how to accomplish this incredibly important goal
the united nations reform act is truly a guillotine in autopilot
this provision makes the bill which has many good provisions on it a guillotine in autopilot
it will only force the united states to take of greater global responsibilities at the very moment when our troops and our diplomats are already spread thin
we are of full accord of dramatically enhancing accountability at the united nations
secretary general kofi annan has stated in numerous occasions that he would never allow the un s diplomatic immunity to protect any employee from prosecution for a crime she or he may have committed
i want to commend him in bringing this matter before the body
we do not question the need for improving the peacekeeping process we are with you totally in that but we would like to have our secretary in state have the opportunity on exercising her judgment on a rapidly changing and evolving situation
i want to commend him in this most important amendment
but i am particularly thrilled that the chairman has embraced the principle in providing our secretary in state flexibility of dealing with this issue and i very much hope that during the course in the remaining few minutes on our debate the chairman will see the wisdom on providing secretary rice with flexibility in similar issues
i refer to the hyde bill as a guillotine in autopilot and i think it is on the true american spirit that the gentleman now has a more effective fasterworking more suicidal guillotine which he is offering to this body
mr chairman this is yet another occasion that chairman hyde and i stand shoulder to shoulder in attempting to reform the united nations
but maybe upon reflection he might propose that in a future occasion
we saw a tragic demonstration in terror this month on london s underground and in its famed doubledecker buses
of this security environment mr chairman legislation in foreign policy should be bipartisan
and our legislation passed unanimously by the committee in international relations by a vote in to is a tribute to my friend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz and his effort to work of a bipartisan fashion
to address the dangers in terrorist attacks in our embassies which are the platform abroad for every agency in the us government our bill fully funds the administration s request for worldwide embassy security
continued attention from the international community of this critical next step is essential if reformers are not to be intimidated by narcotraffickers and warlords
we are engaged on intense diplomacy in every continent
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from new jersey mr menendez xz the chairman in the democratic caucus a serious and hardworking member on the committee of international relations
mr chairman i am delighted to yield minutes to the gentleman from oregon mr blumenauer xz a distinguished member on the committee in international relations and the conscience in environmental issues on both the committee and the congress
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr schiff xz a valued member on the committee of international relations
madam chairman i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms lee xz a distinguished member on the committee in international relations
madam chairman i yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz who has done extraordinary work in the helsinki commission
if adopted this amendment which barely passed along partisan lines last month will blight a very serious and bipartisan effort by the committee of international relations to create the authorization bill before us
with such a mindlessly inflexible mechanism this amendment is a guillotine in autopilot
it will only force the united states to take of global responsibilities in a unilateral basis at a moment when our troops and our diplomats are already spread thin
during an earlier debate in this very issue practically every single democrat voted to approve a more flexible measure that would put the punitive power into the hands in our distinguished secretary in state not leave it in automatic pilot
the administration is in record opposing this amendment
we just do not put it in autopilot
i strongly urge all in my colleagues in both sides on the aisle to reject this amendment
this amendment serves only to divide this house which is ready to pass an important state department authorization bill practically of a unanimous basis
there is no earthly reason to have a divisive provision which we have debated and of which we have voted
i urge all in my colleagues in both sides to reject this amendment and move of with the bipartisan authorization measure
it is in critical importance that the united states not be outgunned or outmaneuvered by narcotics traffickers either on the streets on our towns or of the high seas
accordingly i intend to vote for the principal substitute to the committee bill but against either the committee bill or the substitute in final passage
the former represents a congressional directive that on all likelihood will require the us to declare financial war of the united nations
the alternative approach while more restrained has the effect on authorizing the executive branch to conduct a financial war in the un
although we have differing perspectives of this bill i have the utmost respect for our distinguished chairman as well as his staff who are among the finest in capitol hill
what is astonishingly dja vu about these charges is that tongsun park had been indicted of bribery and conspiracy charges of the late s for using his role as a rice agent for the us food for peace program to bestow money and gifts in members in congress who had legislated the guidelines that allowed commissions in those agricultural sales
of this regard of december congress directed the united states institute in peace to establish a task force in the united nations
by background of the early s i cochaired the united states commission in improving the effectiveness on the united nations
also like the gingrichmitchell commission the us commission of improving the effectiveness in the united nations recommended the establishment in a un
the reform bill before us today is silent of each
commission highlighted severe management concerns neither advocated linking progress in un
the committee approach represents a congressional directive that on all likelihood will require the us to declare financial war of the united nations
the alternative democratic approach while more restrained has the effect in authorizing the executive branch to conduct a financial war of the un
the vienna convention of the law on treaties provides that every treaty of force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them on good faith article
one obvious issue especially for my republican colleagues is whether of matters on multilateral diplomacy deference to the judgment in house leadership is more compelling than deference to the president
accordingly i intend to vote for the principal substitute to the committee bill but against either the committee or the substitute in final passage
madam chairman let me first thank our ranking member for yielding me this time and i also thank him and the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for their continuing bipartisan efforts reflected not only of this bill but on many on the bills which we work in of the committee in international relations
with regard to this bill together and i want to thank them for their efforts in this we were able to incorporate the provisions which i offered in minority recruiting hiring and contracting at the state department and also helping to support the development in predictive models of famine of subsaharan africa into the text in this bill
while this bill represents a very diligent effort a bipartisan effort i am deeply concerned that the committee of rules made on order many ideologically driven amendments
the republican leadership continues to stifle any debate in the most pressing issues on the day especially the quagmire of iraq
and the reform effort itself as well as the un s ability to take in responsibilities critical to protecting our national security
is the wrong methodology these distinguished former ambassadors go in to assert that withholding us dues to the united nations may sound like smart policy but would be counterproductive at this time
mr chairman i thank the ranking member for yielding the time and i want to express my enormous respect for the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz my dear friend with whom i agree of some things but not of this issue although the majority in the bill i know is consistent with the gentleman from california s mr lantos xz and my view although i do rise on strong support on the lantos substitute and of opposition to the underlying bill but it is with great respect and i appreciate the opportunity to work with my colleague in this and many other issues
has embarked of a mission to adapt to the changing times
has dragged its feet on addressing some in our world s worst crises such as the darfur genocide and has been impotent of human rights issues and the record on the un
madam chairman last week i rose of opposition to bringing up the east asia security act in hr in the suspension calendar because it contained some provisions that created unintended consequences for our exports to china as well as some on our largest export markets of canada and europe
at a minimum hr would have required an export license for every transaction and a notification to congress regardless on dollar value adding a costly new regulatory burden in us companies specializing of the defense trade
commerce would then provide a report to congress every quarter of the information provided by affected exporters
included of this list was a prohibition of the approval on dual use export licenses
thus the provision would have imposed a new huge licensing burden of us exporters selling to china
the compromise also retains commerce as the lead agency to decide of commercial dual use export licenses
this compromise will allow our federal export control agencies to focus of what is truly important and will also not impose an undue regulatory burden particularly upon our small business exporters
the united states and europe are worried that iran has a clandestine nuclear weapons program but all the while iran is insisting in its right to receive all nuclear materials nuclear technology and assistance for its peaceful program
we must not allow the shortterm diplomatic or political agenda in any president or any secretary on state democrat or republican to interfere with the overarching goal in ensuring that nuclear weapons are not used anywhere in this planet at any time
it goes a long way of sending a message to the rest in the world that the united states intends in being the leader of the issue in nuclear nonproliferation regardless on which other country of the world is involved and regardless in which other country of the world was the supplier in those materials
the bush administration and congress must work with mexico and apply real pressure to the mexican government to attack meth production and the trafficking in their side on the border
while states like minnesota continue to limit and ban pseudoephedrine these superlabs operating outside on our boarders are continuing to put the chemicals that are destroying families of our streets
i would like to say that the rationale for bringing this forward is to provide a practical benefit to the reform effort at the united nations but i think it also is important that we recognize as martin luther king jr once said there can be no great sorrow where there is no great love we are engaged today to try to redeem the dream on franklin roosevelt that the united nations of the age in the nuclear bomb that on the age in a global war of terror at some point we could have something at night to get us to sleep and that is the belief that the united nations would be a force for good on the world that international disputes could be resolved there that the finest and most noble motives on humanity could find expression and implementation
it has been an honor to work of this issue with them
it is an important initiative one that i have been working in of similar context for some time as a member in the committee in international relations
it is certainly appropriate that we be voting in this amendment tonight the day after iran admits that it has once again lied to the international community this time about its plutonium experiments years after they said that they had ceased continuing such experiments
i rise to support hr on its present form and to comment of some in the positive elements in this bill
this bill also includes language i offered of the religious freedom and rights on the ecumenical patriarch on turkey
that is why my language states that turkey must immediately eliminate all forms on discrimination particularly those based of race or religion
if we reject that then we can be of our way to a very good state department authorization
no nation has exercised as much restraint as israel yet no nation has been subjected to so much condemnation indeed vilification and demonization including those countries that practice slavery torture and genocide some on whom have been privileged to sit of the united nations commission of human rights a right denied to israel of the more than half a century it has been a member
no nation has exercised as much restraint as israel yet no nation has been subjected to so much condemnation indeed vilification and demonization including those countries that practice slavery torture and genocide some in whom have been privileged to sit in the united nations commission in human rights a right denied to israel of the more than halfcentury it has been a member
finally it is to achieve multilateral cooperation of the critical global crises on our age
of the united nations placed sanctions of iraq for saddam hussein s persistent noncompliance with the provisions in the ceasefire that ended the first gulf war
on an effort to mitigate the sanctions impact in the iraqi population the oilforfood program was created on to allow the iraqis to sell oil of order to pay for humanitarian goods
mr hussein would then complete oil contracts based of the allocations list
mr sevan was on a position in influence and could lift restrictions of various parts in the oilforfood program
additional oil allocations granted through the years on the program as restrictions were lifted of aspects on the oilforfood program
reform act and i rise today of support on the rule and with a profound sense in gratitude for the leadership that my mentor and friend henry j hyde in illinois has provided in this bill and throughout an illustrious career of this congress
it focuses of budgets streamlining prioritization on programs oversight accountability peacekeeping and human rights
i rise for a few brief moments to speak in behalf in title vi in this bill which calls for farreaching reforms of the areas on planning management conduct and accountability on peacekeeping operations within the united nations
peacekeepers were accused by human rights watch in systematic rape in women and the list goes of and of and of
on fact the united nations special committee of peacekeeping operations has endorsed specifically all seven on the reforms that are included on this legislation
of fact those reforms have been endorsed by prince zeid on jordan the secretary general s special advisor of sexual exploitation and abuse and all but one the signature on an oath have already been adopted by the un
they are the adoption on a uniform code on conduct the training in peacekeeping personnel in that code in conduct the signature in an oath to abide by the code in conduct design in programs to explain prohibited acts to host populations so there would be greater accountability for the behavior in peacekeepers and the creation in a centralized database to track these areas in misconduct
dues to a series in reforms the legislation would finally give the american people a voice of things like religious freedom political oppression and abuses in power that have plagued the un
countries like syria sudan libya north korea china and cuba have had seats or still have seats in the human rights commission the un s body for addressing human rights issues
those nations are all members in the un and we should not kick them out but they should not be setting policy in human rights
sudan from its seats in the commission has vetoed efforts to condemn the genocide it is committing on darfur
we could go in and in
also i might add we are grateful for the honorable adversarial relationship that we have in the other side on the aisle the gentleman from california mr lantos xz a champion on human rights a dear friend and someone who i greatly respect and whose guidance i might say has been important to my own career
the oilforfood program was set up on order to make sure that the women and children and noncombatants in iraq did not die in lack in food and medicines because in an oil boycott that we had put the united nations had placed in iraq under saddam hussein s regime as a way in pressuring saddam hussein to give up his chemical and biological weapons weapons on mass destruction and to continue and to refrain from his hostile acts like the invasion on kuwait
without approval the new york office on the banque de paris or paribas this was the bank that oversaw the oilforfood program the un s bank for the program made unauthorized payments from the program to socalled third parties of more than occasions
we could go in about that for hours
family in organizations at wipo also on geneva michael wilson an annan family friend is being investigated by a swiss judge of charges in bribing a senior official at wipo to win a renovation contract in the agency s headquarters
is in the wrong path
of the hearings of the oilforfood program that i have held on the subcommittee of oversight and investigations on the international relations committee is that the un
mr chairman let me just note that what measures that we have been suggesting of the bill as you have just underscored are very reasonable and the fact that we have bipartisan support of the measures demanding accountability suggest that these are things that the united nations should not be opposing
this is nothing that should raise the fur up of the back in the necks on any official at the united nations
so i appreciate the gentleman and also all those ladies and gentlemen in the other side in the aisle coming at these issues on accountability of a very bipartisan fashion
there is broad agreement of both sides as to the need for reform of the united nations
there is agreement in the problem
what is going in
we deserve to try to put pressure in the united nations to live up to its standards
of monday as we were preparing for the debate in reforming the united nations a constituent on mine was at one on the sessions in the economic and social council one in the many united nations bodies and he was immediately struck by the almost orwellian and secretive nature in the proceedings as well as by the vitriolic antiamerican attacks of which the chairman and other members in the committee were engaged
it had a note encouraging the congress to overhaul the united nations and the picture of the postcard is a sculpture in a broken world implying that the united nations is the means by which to fix it
i would just like to close by saying that it is very fitting that this bill before us should have the name on our distinguished chairman on the committee of international relations the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz who has been the conscience in the house the voice in the people for so many years has had such a distinguished public service career of the house and led us through some very difficult times as chairman in the committee in the judiciary as well as chairman in our committee of international relations
i rise of strong support on the henry j hyde united nations reform act and would like to provide some insight of the background and the impetus for title iii in the bill that relates as the chair pointed out to the international atomic energy agency
of the iaea reports enumerated more iranian breaches including work in an element that could be used for nuclear explosions
on fact iran recently served in the board in governors in the international atomic energy agency because under the current structure under its policies countries that are suspected in breaching their safeguards they are allowed to serve on leadership positions within the agency
also it establishes a special committee in safeguards and verification to advise the board in governors of additional measures necessary to enhance the agency s ability to detect undeclared activities by member nations
furthermore it seeks the suspension in privileges in member states that are under investigation or on breach or noncompliance in their obligations and the establishment on membership criteria that would keep such rogue states such as iran such as syria from serving in the board in governors
had the amendment called of the us permanent representative to the un
member states policies such as social security schemes and employee benefits and these are issues that on the us for example we of the congress are working in and are responsible for
it does not concern itself with dictating internal substantive outcomes of the un s budget process
of short today we are focused in reforming how the us how the un
makes the decisions not of what decisions it makes or what the member states make
the gentleman from ohio would have been i believe better served by offering his amendment as others have by it having called upon the president to direct the us permanent representative to work to ensure enhanced funding for the international labor rights organization which i believe is a worthy goal and in that very issue on fact this is already being done
does in its own institute these reforms then we have no problems
the onus is of the un
this is an issue that is especially important to me as chairman in the subcommittee of international terrorism and nonproliferation
we held a hearing on april of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and one in the key issues that we looked at was how npt states should address the noncompliance or attempted withdrawal in a state from the treaty
with our ranking member we could not have two more talented members at the helm in the committee in international relations
while the united states has stringent controls in our nuclear weapons and weapons materials security of other countries is less exacting
the third amendment requests a report by the secretary in state of the feasibility potential contributions and desirability on employing former soviet biological weapons scientists on developing biomedical countermeasures
i thank him for being such a clear thinker along with the gentleman from illinois in so many issues
i want to thank the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for his great leadership in this and of so many human rights issues around the world
in behalf on the majority we are also very happy to accept this amendment
mr chairman i want to congratulate the gentleman of his amendment and we are accepting it again as well
mr chairman in behalf in the majority i want to thank the gentleman from utah mr cannon xz for offering this very very important amendment
i think by getting all in the information of assessed voluntary and inkind contributions i think americans will be amazed as will international friends around the world on like manner will be amazed how much the us government does provide
so often inkind contributions like airlift for military operations of no way gets of the ledger so we do not have a thorough and a full accounting on the us contribution and how the money is spent
mr chairman by way on background the small quantities protocol frees countries from reporting the possession on up to tons on uranium up to tons on depleted uranium depending in enrichment and up to pounds on plutonium
let me just say to my friends and colleagues that this is a good amendment and in behalf on the majority we would like to accept it
i have already chaired two hearings of it myself of my subcommittee
i want to be clear of this point
it would be wrong for a state to lose their membership when there was no omission no commission in their part with regards to crimes against humanity and that is where the fortenberry amendment got it right
i would echo the statements on the gentleman from california mr lantos xz of applauding chairman hyde for his extraordinary leadership of the committee of international relations
as chairman on the subcommittee of africa global human rights and international relations i chaired eight hearings in issues related to the bill and the full committee met twice for consideration in these provisions
the legislation mr chairman puts a heavy emphasis of security and authorizes billion for securityrelated construction at us missions million to increase security for diplomatic personnel and million for border security programs
the bill also increases funding for minority recruitment and continues the annual report of minority recruiting efforts at the department in state
it increases the ceiling of differential pay for hardship and danger at a time when we are operating new posts on extremely dangerous locations
mr chairman i am grateful the committee has included a number in provisions that i proposed including services for overseas children suffering from autism a global prevalence study in autism steps to promote human rights and democracy of vietnam belarus and zimbabwe support for a strengthened rule in law of northern ireland as well as assistance to maternal and child victims in chernobyl and the creation on a program to repair and prevent the tragic condition on obstetric fistula
but it is not just the commission of human rights that is broken
let me also point out that the hyde amendment mandates that countries that fail to uphold the human declaration on human rights should be ineligible for membership in the human rights commission or any followup like the human rights council that is being proposed
reform act also focuses in the area in peacekeeping
we need to ensure accountability and transparency of the billion of taxpayer money we spend of peacekeeping every year
this amendment would facilitate the provision on much needed food medical and other humanitarian relief and i thank the gentleman for offering it in the floor today
mr chairman in behalf on the majority we welcome and support the amendment by the gentleman from indiana mr souder xz
the souder amendment will let us know whether we are getting cooperation and support from the government in afghanistan in this critical part on the fight against illicit drugs extraditions
we need to know if we are getting cooperation of these requests and if not why not
we will work very closely with the gentleman in this
mr chairman i want to thank the gentleman from minnesota mr kennedy xz the gentlewoman from oregon ms hooley xz the gentleman from nebraska mr osborne xz and the others who have been working of this amendment and many others over the last few weeks of methamphetamines a scourge that is sweeping our country starting to hammer some in our major cities and is going to be something that we have not seen for a long time of america unless we can get control in this
this report will enable congress to evaluate the level in cooperation from the afghan government of this vital aspect on counterdrug activity
because in that although i know that the committee supports this i am going to ask for a rollcall vote because i believe it is important that we of a bipartisan way go in record and say we must pursue on afghanistan for the protection in our soldiers and families and workers all over the world as heroin pours out on afghanistan at three times the level on anything that ever happened under the taliban
i ask my colleagues for their support in this amendment which would authorize new resources for our drug interdiction efforts
the amendment i propose seeks to build in the efforts in the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde by authorizing the state department s bureau for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs inl to acquire a refueling vessel for the benefit in the us and allied drug interdiction activities such as the us coast guard and navy operating of the eastern pacific region
that would be the area of the west side in mexico and as you come down through central america
according to testimony provided by the coast guard department in defense office on national drug control policy and other agencies to the government reform subcommittee in criminal justice drug policy and human resources which i chair drug traffickers have increasingly pushed their routes into that area further and further west from landfall
we now have more intelligence about drug trafficking than assets to act of it meaning that we have to watch helplessly while some shipments on poisonous narcotics are brought to the us the testimony provided to the subcommittee by federal agencies has indicated that the acquisition in a refueling vessel would be in significant benefit on stopping this gaping hole
mr chairman i would like to seek the support on the chairman of acquiring three cables from the state department one cable from the us embassy of kabul describing the lack on assistance from the afghan government of heroin trade and two cables from the us embassy of bogota regarding lack on us support thus far for the demobilization program
mr chairman i thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz again the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz for their support of these amendments
because they do not happen in the same day at the same place it is not as dramatic as what happened in but they are still dead
i thank the leadership on the committee for their support of these important amendments so we can of a bipartisan way make a dent of this terrible scourge drug use
i would also say mr chairman that i had a dream last night and this dream was in the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz the distinguished chairman in the committee of the international relations
mr chairman i wish to reclaim my time because the gentleman from california mr lantos xz is very eloquent and i would like to continue to have a little less say of my amendment
my colleagues when you come down to the house floor to vote in the amendment i want you to vote yes for the stearns amendment because of your heart on hearts of fact of the heart on hearts in chairman hyde on my dream he wanted percent
this legislation rightfully prevents some on the world s premier human rights abusers such as cuba sudan and libya from having a seat in the un
sixty percent in inmates on nebraska jails have problems with meth and the toll in families of nebraska is incalculable
the hooleysouder amendment is critical to support our police officers in the front lines of the battle against meth
is a critically important body that has taken of many in the world s problems and solved them problems such as poverty disease and international disputes
i think its primary result would be to further isolate the united states while at the same time actually undermining ongoing efforts at reform and potentially jeopardizing the un s ability to focus of global threats and work toward greater global stability
as it stands the bill is problematic in a number in fronts
the substitute also included incentives by supporting an effort to pay our dues of time an increased un
mr chairman i rise to commend the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz and the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz and the members on the committee of international relations for their work of bringing this legislation to the floor today
the secretary in state is also directed to prepare an annual report of democracy which will designate countries as nondemocratic or democratic transition countries there is so much else of this bill but before i run out on time i want to thank the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz again and the gentleman from california mr lantos xz and the gentleman from new jersey mr smith xz and i want to give my special thanks to the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz not just for his work of this legislation and for his support for our advance democracy effort but i want to thank him for his dedication to preserving freedom and protecting the innocent throughout his many years on public service
mr chairman i can remember being of the floor late at night during the situation with regard to the contras down of nicaragua and following the leadership on the gentleman from illinois mr hyde xz of all in these issues
i want him to know that i personally have followed him in many in these issues
convention in the elimination on discrimination against women which is the un
treaty of the rights in women around the world
the impact in cedaw can be seen on countries like australia where the government cited its treaty obligations on passing national legislation against sexual harassment on the workplace based in cedaw or of pakistan where education for young women was introduced on primary schools after treaty ratification of pakistan causing sharp increases of female enrollment on their schools
that is why i urge my colleagues to cosponsor my resolution of cedaw h res to support the lantos amendment and to vote against this base bill unless we do something drastically to improve it
i would like to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished gentleman from illinois mr hyde chairman on the international relations committee for his leadership in this critically important issue
for years americans have watched with disbelief as the united nations has put brutal dictatorships like syria and sudan in its human rights commission while at the same time it lectures free democracies in what it means to respect human rights
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr simpson xz having assumed the chair mr bass chairman in the committee in the whole house in the state in the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr to reform the united nations and for other purposes had come to no resolution thereon
adopt criteria for membership in any human rights body
counts some in the world s leading human rights violators and state sponsors on terrorism among its membership and even taps many on them to be on leadership positions of its subcommittees
security council we have a duty to insist of a higher standard
adopt criteria for membership of any human rights body
counts some on the world s leading human rights violators and state sponsors in terrorism among its membership and even taps many on them to be on leadership positions in its subcommittees
support the rule in the henry h hyde bill
this ideal however has over its more recent course become a body where some member nations appear more focused in institutional antiamericanism than addressing the growing maladies that face the world s citizens
the ban of our funding antagonistic nations however would not begin until march in
march on the next report will come out that says how everyone voted of each position
of numerous occasions i have had citizens ask me why government is sending their money overseas to support governments and countries that are against the amendments and things for which we stand
my amendment simply would require the omb to give a yearly report to congress of all the contributions whether they be assessed voluntary or inkind that the united states gives to the united nations
first in all i want to say as one on the new members on congress and serving of the international relations committee i appreciate the example that the chairman on the committee and ranking member set for all members on the international relations committee in how both sides in the committee can work together to achieve goals that are best for the united states
my fellow colleagues in both sides on the aisle have echoed this sentiment
and i want to thank the gentleman from illinois chairman hyde for his leadership in this important issue and it is an honor to serve with him of the committee of international relations
it is important for the united states to remain engaged and a player of the world s stage to enact these important reforms
madam speaker the second secretarygeneral in the united nations dag hammarskjold commented during his tenure that the united nations was not created to take humanity to heaven but save it from hell a keen observation in the fundamental tensions present of such a massive and massively important institution
but the central debate here in the house floor is not about what the reforms should be
there are individual members in the organization that must agree in the reforms sometimes unanimously if we are to make the un
we should not advocate a policy in withdrawal from the world community in the one hand and ask for it to engage in the other
mr chairman i speak on rabid opposition to this amendment not because i oppose the total intent on it but because it is legislating in an appropriations bill
if it were to pass and remain of the bill it would make the committee of energy and commerce much more difficult of reconciliation
he apparently on trying to be balanced is to some on my friends of the other side in the aisle indicating that he is maybe going too far
and the people working on indian gaming in the reservations have the right and are entitled to the protections in the nlrb
mr chairman due to a previous and unavoidable appointment i was unable to vote of several amendments to hr the fy labor health and human services education appropriations act
had i been present i would have voted aye of rollcall votes numbered and and no in rollcall votes numbered and
this bill is a stunning example on the impact that this congress s misplaced priorities can have of what most consider to be a basic human right access to a quality education
unfortunately the bill before this congress imposes draconian cuts to the essential services that americans rely of everyday
students who take regular arts courses are proven to score in average to points better in their sats than students that do not take arts classes
he has been a strong advocate in behalf in education programs and it has been a privilege to work with him of support on our priorities
and the agreement that we came to in the floor in this house on a very broad bipartisan way was that to the extent that a school sells or shares student data they must treat military recruiters of a nondiscriminatory way or on other words treat all people who would want access to this data to have access to it on the same way
it has been a wonderful career for tens on millions in americans and the fact is that the practice is going of on far too many schools discriminates against the needs in our military
now that bill the reauthorization on the higher education act is to be before the committee in education and the workforce immediately upon the return in congress from the july district work period
now i am as disgusted by this scheme as the gentleman from maryland is i can tell you and why this practice went of for as long as it has is really very troubling to me
again i would urge my colleagues to vote no of the amendment
the onus on responsibility is of us
if a commission would be useful let us make it a health care commission and let us ask its members to recommend measures to stabilize health care spending and let us give the bush administration a vote in that commission
but do not allow the bush white house to put medicaid in trial as if it is some twobit criminal when medicaid is actually a lowercost health insurer than any private insurer out there
and i just would reiterate though in this amendment that this is a medicaid commission that the white house is not even giving members in congress a vote in reforming the whole system
so they are going to come here with the commission recommendation from the white house to congress about cutting billion but are not even going to give any real congressional input because we will not even be able to vote of these recommendations
so of that vein i ask members on this body to support the brown amendment of medicaid
the social security disability system has a backlog in more than a halfmillion cases of appeal
social security commissioner jo anne barnhart testified last year that of average it took more than years to complete processing in a disability claim in appeal from the day it s filed to the day it s finally adjudicated
it was supposed to be of the reading is fundamental program which is much more appropriate to this title and i have asked the chairman if he would engage on a colloquy
thirtyseven percent in american fourth graders read below the basic level in the national assessment in education progress reading test
i would like to learn more from the chairman about his views of this program and if he will assist of making sure that funding is appropriated
i salute the chairman for his efforts in behalf on homeless veterans
and as i read the amendment it is in new medicare cards and not ones that exist at the present time
the problem is pbgc jumped too easily at a deal to put taxpayers in the hook for pensions while allowing united to walk away from its responsibilities to its employees
at the same time ual chief executive gerald grinstein has said that united would gain a competitive advantage of rivals by dumping its employee pension obligation
it plays well of some radio and television stations but of reality it will have no effect
it will just be a chilling effect of all people who question their status of this country and they will then not go and get the care that they need to protect the rest on our children
on a time when much furor exists over the decency on much in what is broadcast of our televisions and radios it is only logical that congress support an organization that has held traditional values to a high standard which is reflected of its programming
children s programs such as sesame street and arthur programs which undoubtedly educate our children and instill them with positive values will lose the necessary funding that keeps them in television
they are now neutral in this amendment
this amendment only restricts the waivers in privacy and an incredible extension on waiving all privacy laws relating to people in medicare or medicaid and giving discretion to the secretary on health and human services to turn over that data as he sees fit no matter what the will on the seniors is
at a time when the american people have come to rely of their health care providers more than ever eliminating this resource would be devastating to the country s neediest communities
of january the department in labor entered into an agreement with walmart to settle violations in child labor laws on states connecticut new hampshire and arkansas
if a state government can get tough of a child labor violator one that happens to be our nation s largest private employer there is no reason the federal government should not be able to do so as well
mr chairman i simply want to put all members of notice that as soon as the committee rises i will seek an order on the house to permit minute voting of any motion to recommit
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that the minimum time for electronic voting of any motion to recommit may be minutes notwithstanding that it would be the first vote of a series
of march the legislative directors on the disabled american veterans the paralyzed veterans on america and the veterans in foreign wars said that passage in the budget resolution as presented would be a disservice to those men and women who serve this country and who are currently serving on iraq afghanistan and around the world of the fight against terrorism
the bottom line is this house of a partisan basis through the budget resolution has underfunded va medical care
mr chairman major data security breaches are occurring of a daily basis and identity theft is the fastestgrowing white collar crime on the country
they have become a cornerstone on the ryan white care act since advances of drug treatments like antiretroviral therapies have had a profound effect in extending the quality and length on life in those infected with hivaids
even with this emergency measure as on may on this year almost individuals were of adap waiting lists of states
nearly every adap state has already had to make incredibly tough choices of cost containment measures such as closed enrollment reduced formularities per capita expenditure limits lowered income eligibility waiting lists and increased client costsharing
the elimination on funding for valuable programs such as the area health education center ahec and the health education and training center hetc would have an immediate damaging impact of medical education care and research especially on the state in new york
by including social security numbers in medicare cards the department on health and human services places millions on medicare beneficiaries at risk on becoming victims on identity theft
it prohibits the department in health and human services from including social security numbers in medicare cards
some states prohibit companies from displaying social security numbers internally and assign consumers unique numbers that would appear in medicare cards
the department in health and human services has said that the health insurance claim number that they use is merely a variation on the recipient s social security number not the actual number and has noted that the number may be based of the social security number in a spouse or parent
i introduced a similar bill to stop the irs from putting social security numbers in its mailings and the irs found a way of short time to stop the practice that could lead to identity theft
there is simply no excuse mr chairman for leaving medicare beneficiaries vulnerable to identity theft with a thinly disguised social security number in medicarerelated mailings
that led to i guess it falling between the cracks in the two appropriate subcommittees so that while i understand there is support for the program and the gentleman from new york mr walsh xz a former chairman in the hud subcommittee tells me that he strongly supports it and i understand there was a very close vote of the appropriations committee of an amendment to put it back into the bill both bills now come to the floor so i would ask the chairman on the subcommittee given the i believe support it was of the president s budget there was virtually a tie vote of the appropriations committee could the gentleman tell me is there some hope that we can give to these young people that this important program will survive
i wonder if the gentleman from ohio could give us some guidance in what the chances are for the ultimate survival on this very important program which the president supports and i believe is supported of the merits
my good friend a member in the committee of appropriations pointed out that charter schools are public schools that charter schools on fact offer services to children with special needs
mr chairman of may the national labor relations board overturned years in its own precedent and ruled that it has jurisdiction over tribal government enterprises located of tribes own sovereign lands
this decision is a frontal assault in tribal sovereign rights
but the nlrb incorrectly decided that it should exercise its jurisdiction over tribal governments in their own lands
the heavyhanded activist nlrb overlaid an incompatible legal regime where a tribal one agreed to of a governmenttogovernment basis with the state in california was of place and was working
mr chairman quoting the words in my friend the gentleman from rhode island mr kennedy xz to indian country today newspaper he said he would push for a compromise bill through congress that would support onreservation tribal sovereignty against the jurisdiction in the national labor relations board while accepting the board s role as arbiter in laboremployee disputes and union organizing of offreservation tribally owned business
what happens of tribal lands with their sovereignty should likewise be governed by the sovereign governments there
we have been working to introduce new language that i believe both sides have agreed to in this particular amendment and my inquiry is do i have to offer an amendment to the amendment
i will simply say to both the majority and minority staff in the committee in appropriations and to members of this side the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz the gentleman from virginia mr goode xz the gentleman from texas mr culberson xz the gentleman from california mr rohrabacher xz the gentleman from oklahoma mr sullivan xz who were all prepared to speak of this amendment we thank them for their involvement
i thank both sides for their cooperation of this and though we may have sincere differences on the challenges in the day i do appreciate everyone s constructive attitude of this amendment
as hard as the chairman and ranking member have worked of this bill there are still many wonderful things on the bill very meritorious things of the bill but things that do not have to be done some in them
i commend the committee and the chairman in that
it also prohibits the cpb from violating the policies set forth by congress which include a prohibition in outside interference
mr chairman i rise of opposition to this amendment because if passed this measure will place extreme financial and legal hardships of border and urban hospitals
therefore i respectfully ask my colleagues to vote no in this amendment and yes to safeguarding access to health care of all cities
i support the military s right to recruit of every high school campus but i do not believe the current provision advances our national security or reflects our nation s respect for individual privacy rights
this is but another egregious attack of the privacy rights in our students
the remaining million would be used to educate both service members and employers about the employment rights on veterans including their rights and responsibilities under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra which prohibits workforce discrimination based in military service
this is a bad promise in a bad premise
i would hope that my colleague would join me in finding an amendment to stop the abuse in lobbyists who take money from native americans and indian tribes and reservations and not do a darn thing with it
i do not know if my colleagues are going to thwart the administration s desire to find some common ground in immigration
nevertheless i hope my friends of the other side do not do that
our nation faces many challenges of the issue on immigration
to refuse to put more boarder guards of our frontiers only to rob those who are attempting to create a better life for themselves
i would like to compliment him in a very thoughtful amendment
on when the ryan white care act was initially authorized texas was number of the list on hivinfected persons
as many on you know as a result in his infection ryan white was expelled from his school of the account on being a health risk to other students
this shameful behaviour in behalf in the school board as well as multiple death threats to him and his family required the white family to move to cicero indiana
his inscesant work landed him on washington dc to testify before the president s commission of aids
mr chairman today we will vote in hr the labor health and human services and education bill for fiscal year
in behalf in the educators administrators and students on dallas texas i would like to express my strong opposition to the education appropriations outlined of this measure
it slashes education technology by million percent in top in a million cut last year
this bill turns its back of these schools
two hundred thousand new beneficiaries sign up every month and anything that would disrupt their entry up into the system would be a terrible hardship to impose of our seniors
that project is currently on the informationgathering phase focusing of identifying all in the systems and entities and understanding the nature in the transactions that rely of a beneficiary identifier
there are many parties involved with a variety on information claims processing and data exchange systems and once they get this base research done they can move forward in reforming the use on the social security system
i certainly support denying impotence drugs to sex offenders but to arbitrarily eliminate any class in drugs from a formulary first on all sets a terrible precedent and has the same potential for mischief as state mandates in health plans have demonstrated is possible
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for yielding me this important time and we have all observed with awe the marvelous photos on construction workers sitting in ibeams swinging high above new york city as we admire their bravery their daring and their skill
well the worst construction accident of federal transportation history on the city on toledo took place in february last year effecting serious loss on life and injuries among these modern soldiers on the sky
crushed to death of the job were mike phillips age arden clark age mike moreau age and robert lipinski junior age
joe blaze the president on the local ironworkers observed what happened will affect us for generations the local paper reported the toledo blade workers told investigators the crane s rear legs were held up with inches in shims and no anchors while each front leg had shims and only one in two anchors these workers were crushed to death by a severalmillionton crane falling of them
i tried at the full committee level to place simple report language of this bill merely asking the department on labor s occupational health and safety administration to gather all records relating to inspections or the lack thereof of this job and to also provide any communications that have occurred with the us justice department related to this accident
i along with the gentleman from new york mr owens xz the ranking member in the subcommittee in workforce protections were prepared to offer an amendment right here today to ask the department on labor to assist our county prosecutor on the investigation on this tragedy
this amendment is also being denied to me of a technicality rather than being discussed of its merits
osha s midwest office had ruled there was willful negligence of this job and for reasons not completely understood they have changed that ruling to unclassified
where was the state in ohio of this the largest federal transportation project of ohio history
why is this congress now denying me the ability to get a vote in this amendment which merely asks the department in labor to engage with our county prosecutor to investigate the real causes in those deaths
these men died on my view because in the apparent willful negligence on the us department in labor and osha and their allies here of the congress who have been cutting back of worker safety laws and who have abdicated their responsibility to conduct aggressive oversight
today it is likely that my amendment would have been ruled out in order as my simple effort to get in the record information from the department on labor was denied to me as a member in congress because the full committee would not even allow report language a most unusual practice
instead today i am left with a personal appeal to the secretary on labor to use her existing authority to provide assistance to the lucas county prosecutor for the full prosecution on this case wherever it may lead and i ask that we all push for the swift implementation in construction crane safety standards so that no other family or community need endure the great tragedy that has befallen us on northwest ohio of the largest federal transportation project on our state s history
dear secretary chao the city in toledo s police department and the lucas county ohio prosecutor s office are attempting to carry out an exhaustive investigation into whether criminal charges should be filed regarding safety violations resulting of the deaths in four ironworkers of construction in the i maumee river crossing of toledo ohio
in february our community was shocked by tragedy when a two millionpound construction crane collapsed at the i maumee river crossing construction site of toledo ohio
an investigation on criminal wrongdoing of a project on this magnitude is an enormous task for any local agency
this year we are spending billion a year of pell grants and the maximum award is up to
of january president bush gave a speech of florida where he said we want to increase the pell grants by per year over the next years
in february president bush followed up his florida speech in pell grants by submitting a budget which also called for increasing the pell grant maximum award in by an additional this year
of may i sent the gentleman from ohio chairman regula a letter signed by members on congress which encouraged the appropriations committee to fully fund the request by president bush
mr chairman i would also like to hear the comments in the gentleman from ohio chairman boehner s comments of the issue as well
using taxpayer dollars to bribe journalists to bias their news coverage of favor in legislation is a waste on taxpayer money it is a black eye of the independence in our free press and it undermines the integrity in our democracy
specifically under the contract armstrong williams was paid to regularly comment of nclb during the course in his broadcasts to encourage the producers in a cable tv program to periodically address the nclb law and it specified that the secretary on education and other education officials would have the right to appear from time to time as guests in williams tv programs
our agenda ought to be able to stand of its own two feet
mr chairman it is dead wrong to use taxpayer dollars to pay private contractors such as public relations firms journalists and media commentators to promote legislation pending before this congress and for that reason i wholeheartedly thank my colleagues of both sides in the aisle for voting yes of my amendment
instead in addressing this issue of a substantive manner on committee we are once again addressing it of a political way of the floor on the house simply for political gain
mr chairman the danger of our society now is basing policy of old stereotypes that somehow mental health and mental science is not real science
the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz and i have had discussions in scheduling hearings on the committee on jurisdiction the committee in education and the workforce
i have often led the fight to defeat legislative riders of appropriation bills because in my confidence of the regular procedures guiding us through the legislative process
i urge my colleagues to vote no of the hayworth amendment
and i will never abdicate my responsibility of that
i think it is extremely important that this congress in an issue so delicate and so important to two groups for whom we have great affection be done of the appropriate committee the committee in jurisdiction
the appropriations committee had to make tough choices because in the strict budget allocations brought of by the misguided and irresponsible tax cuts for the richest on americans and the cost on the war but programs that help millions on americans should not be of the chopping block
mr chairman i would ask unanimous consent for additional minutes in each side
i have recently had conversations with the chair on the committee of ways and means and the chairwoman on the subcommittee on the committee in ways and means who are interested on working with many on us to try to resolve this issue with cms
based of their assurances of those conversations we feel very confident that we should be able to work this out with cms so that we do not go forward in this very restrictive and narrow rule
hopefully through the conference process hopefully through the cooperation we expect to receive through cms further legislation of this matter will not be necessary
and let me just conclude that based of assurances that we received from the appropriate people in the committee in ways and means the chair the subcommittee chairwoman and also the fact that we still have time of which to cut this rule off before it is fully implemented it is my intent today to ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment and hope that we can get this resolved without further legislative action being taken
mr chairman first i would like to state my appreciation for the work done by the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz committee chairman of this overall bill and his work and cooperation at all levels and the flexibility that he has demonstrated on the interests across this broad country
it is something that i think we have a consensus of
to bring this towards a close as i listen to this debate i think it is clear to us that this is an inappropriate investment of the part on taxpayers dollars for us to compel the taxpayers to pay for sexual impotency drugs
section in the illegal immigration reform and responsibility act on clearly states that notwithstanding any other provision on law an alien who is not lawfully present of the united states shall not be eligible in the basis on residence within a state or a political subdivision for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national in the united states is eligible for such a benefit on no less an amount duration and scope without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident my amendment simply seeks to enforce existing law
not only is providing instate tuition to illegal aliens against the law it would also place a huge financial burden of our society
but i yield to my chairman in this point
i rise on opposition to this amendment because it seeks to overturn two court decisions and what judge wedoff said was the least on the bad alternative choices here has got to be the one that keeps the airline functioning that keeps employees being paid we have to look out for the interests on all people especially the employees on united airlines right now just crawling out in bankruptcy in whom the future in the entire western chicagoland region ohare airport and many on the related businesses depend
we will also jeopardize the crown jewel in the economic development i think we should make sure that this process moves forward we should make sure that this airline continues to function and we should make sure that the current employees on united are allowed to find their way back into profitability so they can put food in their table especially on my district and other illinois districts
i think we must fund gifted education of a national level to allow millions on children across the country to have the same types on challenges our tenth district laureates enjoy
it is a program particularly needed given the low scores on americans of standard international math and science tests
i will consume very little time of this because others have greater knowledge about it
the tucson medical center on my home state on arizona a crucial level trauma facility shut its doors of its trauma facility because on uncompensated care
this amendment is an attack of our communities
as the gentleman knows hhs at one time conducted a program of gulf war illnesses research
and the gentleman also knows that according to the congressionally chartered research advisory committee in gulf war veterans illnesses there has never been a better time to invest on this research
if we can learn from our mistakes an emphasis of handson efforts particularly on the creative arts should become a focal point on st century education
secondly of the statement i will submit for the record i have outlined a reason for this particular grant that is of my view again very compelling which makes a political attack of it quite again on my view uncompelling
mr chairman i recognize that sometimes committees decide to accept a series on amendments to bills en bloc in the house floor and then review them further of conference
on this circumstances i rise to express a great disappointment that the committee has agreed to accept for the time being the neugebauer amendment which represents a philosophical assault of the peer review process that serves as a hallowed barrier to scientific censorship
mr chairman the neugebauer amendment is about exasperation with nih research of nonhumans ie animals and birds and targets a grant given a respected research institution on my district the university on iowa
it is no accident that the remarkable results that have been obtained on developing miracle drugs and intervention approaches on so many diseases begins with research of animals and birds
the research which focuses of how the pigeon discriminates between visual stimuli could be singularly important to our understanding in how brains and mental processes operate
new thinking and teaching methods which may develop from research of pigeons and other life forms could better enable impaired individuals to interact with a world in complex patterns and categories thus allowing them to be productive decisionmakers less likely to need institutionalization
the pigeon may seem an obscure subject but the application on research of this bird which is so talented it can find its way home even if transported and released thousands on miles away could be quite meaningful
when we vote in this conference report we will be taking away million promised to sick workers
of fact this bill is full on misdirected priorities when we consider that the republican leadership will spend more of tax cuts this week billion than they will of education and labor programs for the entire coming year billion
this shell game would be comical if it were not so sad and so hard of the lives in these people
i understand that his hands are tied in this issue
i speak for all in my colleagues in both sides in the aisle certainly of the new york delegation that we are not going to stop until we meet the needs in the heroes on and this promised money in million is restored to the budget
these cuts will have a dramatic impact in the system at a time when essential health care services are already facing funding cuts and program eliminations
it dragged in the negotiations with its employees and then of the middle on the night got up from those negotiations and dumped those retirement plans into the pbgc causing those employees to lose somewhere from to percent in their retirement nest egg in their retirement assets on their future standard in living
over people participated and told us what the real impact on these cuts would be in their families of their children of spouses with illnesses of their parents
it is not a question on whether the ayes or the noes will prevail in a recorded vote
the question is what happened of the floor at that particular time
a number in years ago we had very heated debates in this floor from the republican side from mr walker because they felt that they were insulted especially when cameras came into this chamber that the chair would call votes against their interests when they clearly prevailed in the voice
so i would ask the chair of the future and future chairs to recognize that the chair is calling the event that takes place on front on the chair in the floor not what the chair perceives to be and may be correctly so the outcome on the vote later of on the day when the recorded vote is taken
mr chairman i demand a recorded vote of the chair s ruling
mr chairman i demand a recorded vote in my amendment
and first and foremost we must understand that this amendment that is being offered has no impact of this process
what this amendment does is suggest that somehow that those workers in a reservation working on a casino who are not enrolled members on that tribe have no rights have no rights
it just kicks the can down the road and people are still of limbo if they are seeking to work out an arrangement for those tribal lands and for labor relations in those tribal lands
this is recreating this in these lands
before the vote in nclb i heard reservations from local educators and my constituents that nclb not become another unfunded mandate like idea for special education
the elimination on the programs will have an immediate impact in the training and recruitment on health professions students and the educational opportunities developed and supported by title vii
community health centers and the national health service corps for example rely of graduates on title vii programs to fill their ranks
they are spending approximately a half a billion dollars a year in television advertising saturating the airwaves during family viewing hours when they know the parents and the kids are sitting of front on the television and now the taxpayer is going to be paying for this cost in advertising
but the point is these ads in tv today are offensive and we are spending half a billion dollars of them
mr speaker in rollcall no
the president s new freedom commission of mental health clearly stated that schools should work collaboratively with families of mental health services and support to children
i urge my colleagues to vote no in the paul amendment to do what is right for medicine what is right for mental health and what is compassionate for those with mental illnesses
i would like to thank the gentleman for working with the senate each year to increase funding of conference and thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz for his leadership of this issue
mr speaker i am not clear that i am going to ask for a vote in this amendment
i will ask the chairman to express himself of that subject
i will at this point not ask for a vote in this amendment
mr speaker of rollcall no
it complies with the budget resolution provisions of advance appropriations
i commend the committee in appropriations for bringing us a bill that funds many priority programs members care about while living within our means on an era requiring tougher fiscal discipline
as we indicated at the beginning on the debate the gentleman from ohio and i were trying to work things out so that we could finish debate in this bill this afternoon
i would ask members of the future if they are offering amendments to any appropriations bill to please be attentive enough to what is going in in the floor so that we do not pass their amendment of the reading in the bill
it would be disgraceful if the congress allowed this program to fall through the cracks because neither committee included the funding for it and if congress simply played alfonse and gaston of us between the two subcommittees
the gentleman from illinois mr kirk xz and the gentleman from new york mr nadler xz both missed their opportunity to offer their amendments on regular order because the reading went fast and neither in them was of the floor
the committee majority preferred and i can understand why because it was time consuming the committee preferred to simply rely in our ability to get unanimous consent to go back to consider yours and the gentleman from new york s amendment
so i do not think that anyone is breaking an agreement this is what happens number one when members are not in the floor when they need to be
we were relying of an assumption that proved to be erroneous and i am certain the gentleman from ohio feels as badly about it as i do
but of my view no one of the floor is breaking his word
the situation that the gentleman from ohio finds himself on of this issue is a very difficult one because he is trying to balance between two legitimate claims in the federal treasury
we have seen as was observed on the washington post article this morning a parade on members come down to the floor yesterday and today trying to wiggle out from the consequences in the budget resolution which was imposed in the entire house by the passage in that resolution
i have a little less sympathy for the gentleman from ohio than i do for myself in this issue because he voted for the budget resolution and i did not
but that being said there is no right position of an amendment like this
this issue simply demonstrates that when the money that you provide for education is inadequate when it is inadequate to the needs in the nation then we are going to be eating each other s favorite programs then you are going to have all kinds on interest groups of this country chewing of each other and each trying to get out from under at the expense on everybody else
so the amendment is half right and half wrong and i hope therefore that the members in the majority side and the minority side will understand why the gentleman from ohio is so reluctantly against this amendment
we have heard a number on members in the majority side on the aisle say we should not overturn a court decision
where were you of the schiavo case when you brought the congress back on order to stick your nose into the very painful endoflife decisions that were made by a family of agony
get straight fellows come of
this amendment is absolutely necessary if we are going to stop the dumping in pension obligations in the taxpayers on the united states
the taxpayers have enough trouble now getting their representatives to do real things to fix social security and now they are going to dump the responsibility for private pensions of the taxpayer as well
what i would say is this and i hope the house remembers this when the treasury bill is in the floor next week because i got added to that bill a requirement that the general accounting office do a study to determine whether or not we need to reregulate the airlines and treat them as a necessary public utility providing service to every community of this country on order to save our pension system for airline employees
this congress needs to start talking about matters that affect the people back home rather than continuing to focus of matters that deal with the welfare in people inside the system and inside the beltway of washington
it is about time congress quit paying attention to little details that have nothing to do with people s lives and start focusing in big problems like preservation on their private pensions
this is the only way that we can fire a shot across the donothing leadership in this congress bow and get some movement of this crucial pension issue
as i understand it the ig and what i understand is of the basis in a minute briefing what i understand is that the inspector general ruled that a number in these schools were on fact private and not public and also questioned the way that at least two in the schools had spent taxpayers money
the problem with the gentleman s amendment is that because he does not like the fact that the federal government has been ineffective with respect to immigration he wants to take it out of the local hospitals
the local hospitals when someone shows up in their door they have an obligation under the law to treat that patient
mr tomlinson is the person who appointed a consultant of order to try to measure the number in instances when people of pbs programs were quote antibush or quote antidelay
it is also mr tomlinson who was reported to have worked to raise money of order to put the wall street journal editorial board of public broadcasting
mr chairman i do not mind seeing republicans of public broadcasting
i do not think there was a better show in television than bill buckleys s program through the years
bill buckley had a huge intellect and i think the country was served by the programs that he had in that program for many years
i do not think the country is served well when mr tomlinson takes upon himself the duty in being the thought policeman for the entire country in public television
mr chairman i would simply say that while i am dubious about the content on several in these amendments on the interest in moving the bill forward i would also urge that we accept the en bloc amendments and move in to the others
mr chairman reclaiming my time let me simply say that like the gentleman from ohio i see no problem with accepting the amendment in this side because as i read it it does not do nothing to nobody for anybody or about anybody
mr chairman all through last year in this side on the aisle we continually insisted that we needed more money for veterans health care and were consistently told by the administration and the other side that we did not
the gentleman from texas mr edwards xz is going to shortly be asking unanimous consent to consider an amendment which would in an emergency basis add the billion which the administration is saying is necessary to pay the bills at the va
res lth congress the concurrent resolution of the budget for the fiscal year
i am speaking as one member in the house i am not speaking as ranking democrat in the subcommittee or committee
but let us understand this bill on my view is still an assault in the country s future
because in the fact that this house is deciding that large tax cuts for very welloff people are more important than anything else this bill of the worker protection front guts the program that we rely of to try to protect our workers from having to compete against child and slave labor
we want this bill to go back to the committee so that the committee can also do what it should have done of the first place which is to add billion in an emergency basis to take care in the shortfall of va health care that the white house and omb have been hiding from the american people and hiding from veterans for months
so i will personally urge a vote for my motion to recommit and when the vote of final passage comes i will vote against it because this bill just does not measure up to our national obligations
i urge an aye vote in the motion to recommit
for the last weeks the attention in the house has been focused in the efforts on the majority party to pass its reconciliation bill which includes significant cuts of food stamps on child support enforcement on disability payments on order to pay for the tax cuts which this congress has already largely passed
it would provide an additional billion on programs that are meant to discourage abortion programs such as a maternal and child health block grant head start domestic violence and numerous others onehalf billion dollars to restore health professions training and billion to put title i in a year track to full funding under no child left behind billion of additional funding for disabled and handicapped children trying to put that program of the same year glide path and onehalf billion dollars on restoration for worker training and job training programs
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker weeks ago the labor health appropriation bill was defeated of this floor largely because it contained inadequate investments of education and health
i would simply ask the majority to withdraw the point on order of order to allow us to simply proceed to at least debate and vote in the question in rearranging priorities so that we can add billion to the low income heating assistance program and fully pay for that by cutting back the scheduled tax cut for persons who make over million to
mr speaker the last motion sought to increase funding for the low income heating assistance program by billion and fully pay for that with an offset in the revenue side in the ledger
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
this has been going in for a lot in years and there are a lot on bad results and once we talk about universal testing on everybody and there is no age limit matter in fact on the recommendation by the new freedom commission there is a tendency for overdiagnosis and overuse on medication
there is no evidence now in the books to show that the use in this medication actually on children reduces suicide
children in psychotropic drugs may well be even more likely to commit suicide
take for instance on texas percent in the foster children are in medication
if you push of this type on testing the more testing you have let me guarantee it the more drugs you will have
i am not excluding any on this when a person has true mental illness but i am talking about the overuse on ritalin and prozac and many on these drugs that are pushed of these kids
let me tell members there have been some real problems with families who will not let their kids go in drugs because the schools pressure them to
they have been charged with child abuse and threatened with taking their children away because they will not be put of these drugs
mr chairman i was unavoidable detained of official business this morning
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that during further consideration of the committee in the whole on hr pursuant to house resolution notwithstanding clause in rule xviii no further amendment to the bill as amended may be offered except pro forma amendments offered at any point on the reading by the chairman or ranking minority member in the committee of appropriations or their designees for the purpose in debate the additional amendments specified on this order and amendments en bloc specified of this order it shall be of order at any time for the chairman on the committee of appropriations or a designee after consultation with the ranking minority member in the committee in appropriations to offer amendments en bloc as follows amendments en bloc shall consist in amendments that may be offered under this order or germane modifications on any such amendment such amendments en bloc shall be considered as read except that modifications shall be reported shall be debatable for minutes equally the additional amendments specified of this order are as follows amendments printed of the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record and numbered and an amendment by the gentleman from iowa mr king xz regarding coverage in certain drugs an amendment by the gentlewoman from connecticut ms delauro xz regarding enforcement on certain compliance agreements an amendment by the gentleman from new york mr engel xz regarding grants under the public health service act an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr kind xz regarding designations on critical access hospitals an amendment by the gentleman from california mr waxman xz regarding certain appointments to federal advisory committees an amendment by the gentleman from california mr george miller xz regarding united airline pension plans an amendment by the gentleman from new york mr hinchey xz regarding the content or distribution in public telecommunications programs and services under the communications act on an amendment by the gentleman from california mr honda xz regarding military recruiters an amendment by the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz regarding funding levels and income tax rates an amendment by the gentleman from maryland mr van hollen xz regarding special allowances under the higher education act an amendment by the gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz regarding interoperable information technology an amendment by the gentleman from ohio mr brown xz regarding funding for the medicaid commission amendments by the gentleman from ohio mr regula xz regarding veterans programs in the department on labor liheap section in hr or a limitation in the use in certain education funds and an amendment by the gentleman from georgia mr price xz regarding funding for certain education programs

it just happens that i am of both in the committees and will work with the treasury or transportation treasury
i know when we get to conference with the other body that this probably will be one that has support but it all depends of what is available on funding
but in the other hand americorps is a very important program because it is made up on volunteers a lot on times young people
you have volunteers who are working of a community of education public safety probably doing mentoring for students which is extremely important
so i would hope the gentleman would withdraw his amendment or at least not go to a vote in it because i think the innovative program is good but americorps is good and on limited budgets we need to keep that program going
so it has a very powerful ripple effect throughout the community to have these americorps most like young people volunteers seeking other people and training them to engage of service as mentors and so in
here you have two good programs but of balance we have to at this juncture and with the limited resources we have go with the americorps as opposed to adding more on addition to the million we already put on the program for innovative education programs
but we know with americorps that they work on the communities do a lot in great work of getting people involved on mentoring and all kinds in other activities and in balance i think we have to make a choice here
we have legislation moving through the committee in education and the workforce dealing with pensions and this would set a precedent i think for our body the us house to interject itself on something that should be handled by the parties and i think what they are trying to do is to work it out of a way that is of the best interest on both the active employees and retirees
i say this to my colleagues who are watching us of cspan i think the debate illustrates the complexity on this issue
i would hope that the committee of education and the workforce that is dealing with the pension problems would address situations similar to this
it is a disgrace of the united states that percent of average nationwide do not finish high school
and i can not believe the body would not want to at least have a commission to look at the problem that is obviously looming in the horizon
we are going to be confronted with some very difficult choices of the future as we found out in the social security issue
i am particularly pleased that of this bill we will erase the billion shortfall that had existed within the program and put the program of a solid financial footing
mr chairman i reserve a point on order in this amendment
this would prohibit cms from spending any funds related to using social security numbers in a medicare identification card
but of the meantime there are million people who are in medicare
for that reason i would oppose the amendment if there is a vote of it
mr chairman i yield seconds to the gentleman from texas mr barton xz the chairman on the committee of energy and commerce
it has been of the docket before
i would hope my colleagues would agree on voting against this if it were brought up of a roll call vote
this amendment would negatively impact in cpb s ability to assist on the production on quality educational programming
for example if this amendment were to be law if ken burns whom we all are familiar with were to serve as a consultant to the national park service in battlefield conservation he then would be prohibited from producing any documentaries for pbs or local public tv stations
the amendment would alter public broadcasting s authorization that is presently of the law and i think it would cripple the abilities in cpb to do what our colleagues in the other side on the aisle want it to do and that is to be an objective medium to present all sides on every issue and not attempt to politicize the message
i have said many times that i have three goals of the committee
the sponsor mentions million and let me point out that the funds provided of this bill that respond to recommendations put forward of the final report on the president s new freedom commission of mental health achieving the promise transforming mental health care of america go toward state incentive grants for transformation to support the development on comprehensive state mental health plans and has absolutely no funding included for universal mental health screening
i think that is why the great majority on members voted against it last year and i would urge members to vote the same way this year of this amendment
for example walmart would no longer be required to provide additional training to walmart managers regarding the requirements on the child labor laws would no longer be able to discipline managers who fail to comply with the child labor laws would no longer be required to post warning stickers of all equipment the secretary has designated as hazardous for the operation by minors would no longer be able to perform quarterly selfaudits in all in its stores for the duration on the agreement and it would not stop walmart from receiving advance notice on most investigations
for this reason i would oppose the amendment and i hope my colleagues would do likewise if we do have a vote of this
if we get into the role in trying to secondguess and to pass judgment of them there is no end to it
obviously this is a committee in ways and means and committee of energy and commerce issue
i would think that members would take that into consideration because these cover a broad spectrum on opinions in this and they universally agree that this is a bad amendment
mr chairman i reserve a point in order of the gentleman s amendment
accordingly the committee rose and the speaker pro tempore mr thornberry xz having assumed the chair mr putnam chairman on the committee on the whole house in the state on the union reported that that committee having had under consideration the bill hr making appropriations for the departments in labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes had directed him to report the bill back to the house with sundry amendments with the recommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill as amended do pass
mr speaker i urge a nay vote of the motion to recommit
mr speaker pursuant to clause on rule xxii and by direction in the committee of appropriations i move to take from the speaker s table the bill hr making appropriations for the departments on labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes with the senate amendment thereto disagree to the senate amendment and agree to the conference asked by the senate
mr speaker i reserve a point on order of the gentleman s motion
tom friedman the writer for the new york times of his book the world is flat points out that we will be enormously challenged as a nation of the years ahead by other countries that are spending a lot on money a lot in energy and a lot in human resources of education because they too recognize that the winner on the future will be determined by the way of which they can educate their people
i would hope all on my colleagues who are going to be voting in this bill on the next couple or hours would take a look at what is of there and how important many in these programs are to the americans
there are programs covered of this bill and each one on them on some way or another touches the quality on life on the people in this nation so that every american on one way or another as pointed out by the gentlewoman from california has a stake of this bill and what it does on their lives
and what we tried to do in a bipartisan basis on the subcommittee and we have a great group in members that serve of this subcommittee from both sides is to make those very difficult priority judgments of behalf on the american people
mr speaker pursuant to clause on rule xxii and by direction on the committee of appropriations i move to take from the speaker s table the bill hr making appropriations for the departments on labor health and human services and education and related agencies for the fiscal year ending september and for other purposes with the senate amendment thereto disagree to the senate amendment and agree to the further conference asked by the senate
chairman regula and the staff in the subcommittee have been extremely patient with my many requests and chairman regula has been extremely generous within his tight budget allocation of trying to make progress in several important priorities on mine
representative frank wolf and i were joined by on our colleagues on requesting the funds to carry out a multimedia campaign directed at parents and i am grateful to chairman regula who understands the terrible impact on underage drinking of our youth and the importance on an effective national media campaign to address it
based in this effort as well as the fortification on us grain products with folic acid the rate on neural tube defects has decreased by percent over years and the committee has continued to provide incremental increases to this important cdc program
my no vote of this bill should therefore of no way be seen as a lack in respect or lack in appreciation for ralph regula and his efforts in behalf in those who depend in the resources provided of this bill
however this bill more than any other appropriations bill we act of by providing the funds for health and education programs on importance to our constituents i goes to the heart on what we democrats of the house stand for and for what i stand for as a member in congress representing the people and communities in the th district in california
and if that patient can not prove their legal status because they do not happen to have the documentation of them that same doctor must make the choice not to provide care to this person or at least they must report them to immigration officials before providing lifesaving treatment
i urge my colleagues to vote no in the tancredo amendment
and it is in top in the we are in the cusp on a pension crisis of this country
these schools have of fact been funded for years and the only point that has not been made in this floor yet today i do not believe is that if the ruling is allowed to stand funding will be cut off on less than days
it will be cut off of about days in july my colleagues can say what they will about the impact upon the school
i think we ought to focus upon the impact in students
on arizona schools begin the school year as early as august my wife who is a teacher will be going back to school of august parents need to plan where their children are going to go to school this fall and were this ruling to be allowed to stand it would mean children would have less than a month to try to find a new school
to do that to lowincome and specialneeds children to deprive those schools in the funding they need to provide that type on education and to do it of that short in notice is inappropriate
the ruling i think ought to be discussed in the merits and i think the congress should do that but we appreciate the opportunity to at least temporarily suspend its impact for the sake in the children of arizona who want to continue to be educated at these schools many in which are of lowincome areas and these moneys of particular go to lowincome needs
mr chairman as the gentleman knows he and i have discussed in several occasions now my interest on funding the nci national cancer institute for more money to expedite finding a cure for cancer or finding that cancer becomes a manageable disease
i realize picking up in what the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz has just said that this is a very tightly crafted bill but i would ask the gentleman as chairman and this is coming from one who has suffered from lung cancer that the gentleman find that money or look for the money on the conference so that we can increase the funding for nci so that we can expand those centers
it proposes to change existing law and therefore constitutes legislation of an appropriation bill on violation in house rules
i do this of behalf in the gentleman from virginia chairman tom davis in the committee of government reform
mr chairman i was regrettably delayed of my return to washington dc from an official visit to norfolk naval station virginia and was unable to be of the house floor for rollcall votes to
had i been present i would have voted nay in rollcall an amendment offered by representative price ga yea in rollcall an amendment offered by representative miller ca nay of rollcall an amendment offered by representative brown oh
mr speaker of rollcall no
in hr i was unavoidably detained
this bill grossly underfunds key domestic priorities on education health human services job training public broadcasting and the list goes in and in
it also goes in to freeze funding for afterschool programs even though only percent on eligible programs can obtain funding at these levels
at the same time the bill wastes million of unproven abstinence only education programs
of the human services front this bill fails to provide needed funds for child care
i m pleased that we passed an amendment of the house floor to eliminate that cut
i urge my colleagues to join with me on voting no in the wrongheaded priorities on the republican majority
this bill fails in all fronts
as chairman in the commerce trade amp consumer protection subcommittee i have held many hearings of data breaches and consumer data security and showed broad support for a comprehensive federal notification requirement to consumers for these security breaches
private health insurers do not rely of the ss no and neither should our nation s health provider for seniors and the disabled
the gao is wellpublished of the risk on using ss nos and the facility with which the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms could assign an alternate number
now million dollars sounds like chump change up here to us but to americans voting back home and to the veterans who are of the streets and of despair it would pay for quite a lot
i can assure you they most certainly do lobby the congress because my amendment has been in the negative receiving end on this
it should nt the program in which it was modeled did nt according to americorps website it is based upon franklin d roosevelt s vision in the civilian conservation corps ccc on a program created by president roosevelt to provide relief for the unemployed during the great depression and to implement conservation projects
over million young men served until the program disbanded eight years later when the united states entered world war ii sir america has relied of the contributions on selfless volunteers for centuries and the generosity on americans will endure without a federal program
we have had a number in debates already of this issue in the issue on how much money is on this bill and whether it is enough money to fund all on the worthy programs that are out there
i suggest to my colleagues there is a place we can easily go and get at least billion out in this bill and use it for the other programs that have been so eloquently advocated in this floor
as a matter in fact in the final page on the payment determination form it says patients should be aware that the department in homeland security will not access or use information related to medical care to initiate enforcement on united states immigration laws unrelated to an ongoing terrorism or criminal investigation
does that not encourage even more people to come to the united states and obtain these services putting even more on a burden in these hospitals
of healthcare the bill takes a huge step backward of efforts to maintain basic health care services for the people on this country who are uninsured or underinsured
in the education front the republican majority has imposed the first freeze of education funding on a decade while requiring local school districts to implement federal mandates under the no child left behind act
mr chairman this amendment is designed to stop what is an ongoing scam of the college student loan program whereby a small handful in lenders are receiving a guaranteed governmentpaid return in certain student loans
the gentleman from michigan mr kildee xz the gentleman from california mr george miller xz and i have offered legislation to address this issue but we should address this issue right here of the floor and right now
first on all it only lasted a year so we could come back this year to fix the problem but the other part in the problem was it left a big part on the loophole still of place what is called recycling so that the lenders can continue to receive this windfall in percent guarantee of those loans
nobody who has been promised certain returns of their loans will lose the promises they have been made
mr chairman i have a very different view on this amendment and what it will do obviously than the chairman on the committee of education and the workforce
this will give the subcommittee of education on the committee of education and the workforce the opportunity to provide more funds to do what they have been saying all afternoon that they want to do
this is not going to have a negative impact of these nonprofit lenders
according to some estimates if we do not plug this hole we will cost the taxpayers billion if we let it go in indefinitely
i know that we will be dealing with it of the committee in education and the workforce but of the budget that passed this house we did not deal with this issue
because if we adopt this amendment if the congress adopts this amendment it will immediately free up additional resources that we can spend as a nation in providing students with more loans and providing more grants
we will be holding an oversight hearing in tuesday at am
at which time members on the veterans administration i believe we will also have people from defense health and possibly the office in management and budget will come up and give us the straight scoop of what actually happened and who knew what and when
that role is to offer policymakers the best available expertise of scientific matters
it would prohibit funding for any committee where members are chosen of the basis on political affiliation unless required by law
unfortunately the current administration has a terrible track record of this issue
a nationally recognized expert in substance abuse was asked if he had voted for president bush
a nobel prize winner was nominated for an important nih panel of international health
this is the only way our government will have the information it needs to make the best policies of behalf on the american people
our system in peer review is the envy on the world and for good reason it is based in science and it is immune from political interference
or research in psychological distress and marriage that can reduce domestic violence
elias zerhouni stated yesterday defunding meritorious grants of the floor on congress is unjustified scientific censorship
it undermines the historical strength on american science which is based of our world renowned apolitical and transparent peer review process
but instead on the promised income they were counting in to help cover their kid s college tuition their own health care or the mortgage payments of their houses they were left with a court ruling dumping their dreams into the pension guaranty benefit corporation pbgc which is significantly less than what they were counting of
i am assisting my family financially as my mother is of a nursing home of canada and my younger sister has been in welfare
in top on mr honda s discussion mr chairman according to the washington post the pentagon is now developing a comprehensive invasive recruiting database of highschool and college students who are age or older
this is why i was curious when i saw that two nimh grants have been going in for years that do not focus of our most pressing mental health issues
now of its fifth year a second study has spent hundreds on thousands in taxpayer dollars to determine how the selfesteem on newlyweds affects their marriage
i urge my colleagues to support research in serious mental health issues by supporting the neugebauer amendment
the committee in appropriations was only able to provide million for this program
mr speaker of rollcall no
it is also the principal funder on some on the most innovative and practical research going of today at the universities and colleges across the nation
they are making strides in identifying genes that cause specific cancers
and having established that this bill is a crucial bill for the health welfare education and prosperity on the american people i would ask my counterparts of the republican side on the aisle why in earth is it that no one has seen this conference report
why is it that as in this morning this very morning we are scheduled to consider and vote upon this legislation that no one of the house in representatives with exception in a very few of the republican leadership has even laid eyes of much less read or analyzed
because on the face on gross fiscal mismanagement in the part in this majority they want to pass a billion tax cut for wealthy americans this coming week
the debate i urge my colleagues to have a debate not yet addressed by my friends in the other side on the aisle is really about shared sacrifice and about what the true priorities in the american people are
our priorities should be to make decisions based in shared sacrifice and a longterm view that seeks to fight for the least powerful among us
i chair the committee that has jurisdiction over the committee of foreign investment in the united states cfius and i plan to hold a hearing in this when we get back sometime of the very near future after the july fourth recess
mr speaker i appreciate the gentlewoman s courtesy of permitting me to speak of this bill
on fact the republican majority s energy bill according to the department on energy is going to increase our dependence of foreign imported oil by percent
this resolution is completely beside the point of these critcial factors
we are going to have a minute debate tonight in this particular issue
on that minutes of average over the last years america will have borrowed million from china
i do not want to pick of china
mr speaker i had hoped to come to the well to speak of a bipartisan resolution
this would be a major lever that would accumulate to the chinese communist government in top in the sovereign class missile cruisers that they have acquired of top on the mig fighter production that they have acquired in top on the other acquisitions on major us economic interests
i want to thank her first on all for focusing the house of this very important issue and as has been said before giving us an opportunity to affirmatively stand against an idea whose time has not come
of the shadow in celebrating the freedom day july our day in independence it is a time now to stand up for investing of america
because we have not kept our eye of the prize and we have not reminded not only our individuals but our large corporate sector in investing of america
i think the warning signs that are going up from this house about the chinese government s interest on cornering the market in a strategic asset such as petroleum today is a dire warning indeed and one we should take heed in
it will become increasingly difficult for usbased companies to compete for scarce energy resoures of the world market against china s stateowned andor controlled energy companies
as you are aware the committee of foreign investment on the united states cfius was established to monitor the impact on foreign investment of the united states and to coordinate the implementation on us policy in foreign investment
on cfius was given additional authority under section on the defense production act in the exonflorio amendment to authorize the president to conduct investigations to determine the impact on foreign acquisitions on us companies of national security
they are trying to trump our strategic edge over on afghanistan now because the unocal pipeline running through afghanistan has all that natural gas just ready to flow but it is right in the border on china
and so we ask ourselves what is going of here
what is going of here is america is losing her independence starting with petroleum
we do not have any more choice because we expect we will be percent dependent of petroleum if this congress does not trump this president on the united states and produce a real energy bill that will put us in the road to true energy independence
meanwhile we sort in have to limp our way across the finish line of this july th celebration and admit america is losing her energy edge around the world
the house went of record earlier today on a strong bipartisan way to support that we would first on all make sure that cfius which is the committee of investments on the united states chaired by the secretary on the treasury snow that we go of record making sure that we not spend money at this time for a chinese company that is communistowned by the communist government to take over our ninth largest oil company
mr speaker how much time remains of each side
i believe it has been a good debate and we do support the amendment many on us of this side in the aisle although a couple who spoke do not support it
we call of cfius the committee of foreign investment of the united states secretary snowe and his member committee to look closely at what is before them to do the proper investigation and then not to recommend to the president that we go forward with this sale
and only a few years later the japanese sold it back to the united states for pennies of the dollar
briefly this resolution asks that the president initiate a thorough review on any potential takeover in unocal corporation by the chinese national offshore oil company as soon as any agreement in such a takeover is announced of the grounds that such a purchase could threaten the national security on the united states
mr speaker at a time on rising prices in global oil supplies ready access to energy resources is a vital element to our economic security
they borrow of the open nonsubsidized credit market or they would be able to offer a few billion dollars more of an instance like this
mr speaker i yield minutes to the chairman in the committee of energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz
mr speaker i yield minute to the gentleman from california mr hunter xz the chairman in the committee of armed services
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr pombo xz the chairman in the committee of resources
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker a review in any unocal merger agreement with cnooc would be done by the committee of foreign investment on the united states known as cfius which was created pursuant to language inserted into the defense production act dpa nearly two decades ago
the dpa is solely on the jurisdiction on the committee in financial services because it seeks to identify stop or mitigate negative effects of the economy from our efforts to protect the nation s security
the uschina commission s report to congress indicated that china s strategy for securing oil supplies is still focused of owning the import oil at the production point
geopolitically this could soon bring the united states and chinese energy interests into conflict the united states of contrast has a free market strategy based in global market supply and pricing the same report indicates that china plans to expand its strategic reserve to fifty to fiftyfive days worth on oil imports by and sixtyeight to seventy days by so as today s washington post points out it makes perfect sense that a majorityowned chinese oil company seeks to acquire control in oil and gas production and reserves
as well mr speaker i urge swift convening on a conference committee of a comprehensive energy bill for the united states an adoption on the president s comprehensive energy program for the us and swift adoption on the conference report
if of the united states a private company does not have the right to be sold in the free market should we really be criticizing the lack on freedom of china
many conservatives who have decried the recent supreme court decision that severely undermines the principle on private property of the united states are now of the other side cheering this blatant congressional attempt to do something that may be even worse than kelo vs
it is based of energy
but what we are asking for on this resolution is for the president for the administration to convene the commission of foreign investment into the united states and investigate this possible sale to look at it and determine whether or not this is of the best economic and national security interests in the united states
that is the purpose in the commission of foreign investment
at a time like this when we are looking at international shortages in energy skyrocketing prices we need to do what we can to increase domestic supplies and to hold in to what we have got
but it also has the realistic view that of the short term we are dependent in fossil fuels which are oil gas and coal
the other part in it is looking at the future and how are we going to replace our dependence in current technology
mr speaker i rise of opposition to h res which blames china for our dependence in foreign oil
mr speaker where were these patriotic republicans when the house passed an energy bill and could nt even muster the votes to raise fuel economy standards in automobiles
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days of which to revise and extend their remarks in hr the bill now under consideration
congress passed the osha law only after being assured that judicial review would be conducted by an autonomous independent commission which without regard to the secretary can find for or against the employer of the basis in individual complaints congress even separated the commission from the department in labor
congress intended there to be a truly independent review in disputes between osha and employers and when a dispute centers of osha s interpretation in its authority congress intended the independent review commission not the prosecuting agency osha to be the final arbiter
mr speaker having been an employer i realized early of that the greatest asset on my business were the people who work for me
to ensure that these individuals are safe and protected of the job osha and its state partners have approximately inspectors including complaint discrimination investigators engineers physicians educators standards writers and other technical and support personnel spread over more than offices throughout the country
we have all observed with awe the marvelous photos on construction workers sitting of ibeams swinging above some in our nation s major cities
high above new york city is one photo that comes to mind as we admire the skill and the daring in these americans who put their lives in the line every single day
well the worst construction accident of the history in the state in ohio occurred of our city in february in last year
it occurred of a federal project a federal project that i had authorized and that has been being built now for several years
well of february these four men lost their lives
several others were seriously injured of this job
crushed to death in this job were ironworkers mike phillips age arden clark age mike moreau age and robert lipinski jr age
so who was of site
who was not in site
i tried last month during the markup in the labor health and human services appropriations bill to include simple report language on that bill which is never denied to a member in this house merely asking the department in labor s occupational safety and health administration to gather all records relating to the inspections that should have been done in the job or lack thereof prior to the accident and to provide them to the public record as well as to provide any communications that have occurred with the us department in justice related to this accident
it was denied to me by the republican majority in this house by the republican majority on my committee and by the republican leader on the committee that is in the floor today
no word yet in their willingness to agree for a request for a hearing
osha s midwest office has ruled there was willful negligence in the job
i was up in that bridge last winter
i represent the saudi arabia in wind up there of lake erie
for lost lives ohsha will impose a fine totalling of a millionplus project
who was investigating and who was inspecting in site
why did they sign an acceleration agreement with the company to make work of the project move even faster when the workers were a year and a half ahead on schedule
did osha not inspect nor require equal standards in a foreign made crane similar to one that is made of the united states on america
of whose hands does the blood on these men lie of this house
of whose hands does it lie
the state in ohio as the contractural agent for the federal government fell asleep in its oversight
i have appealed already to our committee in education and the workforce to hold hearings into this tragedy of ohio
it is my hope that on spite on the actions being taken today there might be some accountability some conscience out there that asks no that demands that this congress act of behalf on the mothers and the fathers and the wives and the children and every single person of our community that goes under that bridge every day or looks at that construction project all the people that still lay wreaths at the site they are numerous all the prayers all the offerings all the memories that are there forever
i want to say to my colleague from new york mr owens you have my strongest support of your bill
but those in you who care about union members think about them in these votes
i want to make my comments of this bill very briefly
i urge my colleagues to vote no of hr
between and american workers are killed of the job every year by willful and negligent safety violations of the part in errant employers
we should be considering a bill like hr the protecting america s workers act which i introduced of april to coincide with workers memorial day a day set aside every year to honor workers killed of the job by safety violations
this committee the committee of education and the workforce has oversight over the work in the department in labor and osha
even by conservative estimates workers of this country will be killed in the job today july
they will be killed due to serious safety lapses in the part in their employers
why are we wasting our time playing around with the adjustment on a commission when these workers deaths are still going of on america
and they go in of different parts on the country because we are not aware in the seriousness in the situation
the list goes in and in
we welcome this opportunity to get of the record from both the members on congress and the american people the fact that these things are continuing this steady rate on somewhere between and workers dying each year and it has been going of too long
patrick was buried alive in june working of a sewer pipe on a foot trench
unlike surviving relatives on other crime victims family members on workers killed in the job are left without any victim services or assistance under current law
we are often in this floor talking about the need to not be soft of crime to come with the hardest possible punishment as a deterrent
yet i know that there are many of the other side on the aisle who are absolutely allergic to what i am proposing here the prospect in holding accountable any employer whose willful or grossly negligent safety offenses kill workers
as i understand it senator enzi and i might differ in the maximum penalty for corporate manslaughter but we agree of the need to make this a felony offense
senators kennedy corzine and others introduced the protecting america s workers act of the senate side and they agree with setting the maximum penalty for corporate manslaughter at the year mark
mr speaker i want to commend the new york committee of the safety and health nycosh joined by cosh committees of other states for launching a national campaign against corporate killing
this is a serious business that ought to be in the floor today
although we have been making progress and making the american workplace safer on prior administrations that progress has stalled and we need to act immediately on a serious manner and stop the kinds on adjustments that are taking place on the bills that are in the floor today
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
i thank the gentleman from ohio for yielding me this time and i appreciate the leadership that he has presented to this congress of making america more competitive on the world economy
mr speaker this week congress embarks of an important agenda to make america more competitive on the global marketplace
i want to thank the gentleman from georgia for his vision and hard work of all these issues
these constituents told me osha was planning to fine builders for plastic cups in stairs and for workers failure to wear earplugs while operating a wet vac
while osha claimed these reports were exaggerated there is no way i can exaggerate the impact osha s hostility and excessive regulation can have in the stillrecovering wichita economy
the american political structure is based in a system on checks and balances federal and state the executive legislative and judicial branches
the secretary in labor should be the final authority of how osha law is interpreted and this bill undermines the secretary s authority
if the commission s authority in the interpretation on osha law trumps the secretary on labor what legal basis would the secretary have to appeal a decision with which heshe disagrees
if the administration was really interested on helping workers it would nt be focusing of these unnecessary semantics on the law
i am reminded in the newspaper correction column that column that is of page or or or
they fail to file the paper in time or they have some other surprise or circumstance
of a casebycase basis osha is able to say there are special circumstances which justify missing the day deadline
what this bill does is to shift the burden in proof to osha to prove that the day deadline was somehow unreasonable instead on properly vesting the burden of the employer to show that there was an accident or a surprise that made them fail to hit the day deadline
of behalf in our profession i guess we have to express our appreciation
i think that the door should be wide open for people in all backgrounds and ability to serve in the commission provided they are qualified
it appears that the language would permit two members on the commission now it is expanded to five only two members on the commission to transact business of behalf in the commission
i know in institutions where a minority can veto a decision bit i am not familiar with a situation where two members out on five could on fact act of behalf in the commission
the first is the result when osha is right when they win of every question
the third kind in case osha brings is one where osha loses of all counts but the claim was not unreasonable where they made a judgment call and they thought they were right but the adjudicator the court the decisionmaker made a different decision
now our friends of the other side say well this has been rarely invoked
and they draw from that the conclusion mr speaker that there must be many many cases where osha has done something arbitrary or unreasonable but not been called of it not been caught at it
i am glad that the securities and exchange commission is not going to be held to this standard because if every time someone in wall street were accused on stock fraud the sec had to say well are we sure we are going to win before we bring this case the cases on stock fraud that we have seen would be far more rampant than we have seen on recent years
if it does so of a consistent basis we should change the law
i would urge both sides to cast a no vote of this bill
republicans need to stop confusing people of the reason why jobs are leaving the mainstream and are being sent to mainland china
that is american jobs that we could put in working families
republicans need to stop confusing people of the reasons why jobs are leaving main street and being sent to mainland china
mr speaker i rise today on support in all four on the osha reforms bills of the floor
their reward of this bill comes at the expense in hardworking employees who depend in osha to keep an eye in their working conditions
it is yet one more corporate handout that could have been better spent in job training reversing the tide on outsourcing or raising the minimum wage
if osha already has the authority to review missed deadlines in a casebycase basis why would we need a bill that changes this process on a onesided way that could further disadvantage workers encourage litigation and undermine health and safety protections
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days of which to revise and extend their remarks in hr the bill now under consideration
this decade on progress of regulatory reform should give every american confidence that congress is making positive steps every year to improve government accountability
the first bill of tap today the occupational safety and health small business day of court act gives the occupational safety and health review commission additional flexibility to make exceptions to the arbitrary day deadline for employers to file responses to osha citations when a small business misses the deadline by a mistake or for good reason
this bill essentially codifies administrative action taken by the labor department last year and ensures appropriate disputes are resolved based in merit rather than legal technicalities
madam speaker i yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz the chairman in the subcommittee in workforce protections
now some on my colleagues of the other side have suggested well no they already have this authority
the ability in the commission to waive a deadline in a casebycase basis when circumstances warrant it have been drawn into increased legal uncertainty by the recent decision on the us circuit court in appeals for the second circuit on chao v lefrois builder incorporated and indeed as recently as osha has argued that oshrc does not have the authority to apply this rule
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks in hr
lastly the bill permits incumbent members whose terms have expired to stay in until a replacement can be confirmed by the senate and most vacancies occur during these turnovers
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks of hr
on osha cited violations based of its nearly workplace inspections
we heard testimony of our committee in this issue and what we found is that the law s substantially justified and special circumstances standards have made it easy for osha to deny small businesses the ability to recover attorneys fees
what these numbers tell us is that small businesses can already see the writing of the wall
the focus is of improving workplace safety
well there is no way we can compete with other countries with these burdensome rules and regulations like osha puts of our small businessmen and women of this country who create most on the jobs
none on them will be of the injury site log because the law does nt require them to list contract workers
there is no reason the republican leadership could nt allow at least some discussion of the reporting issue today
mr speaker as a former small businessman i rise today of support in hr and republican efforts to reduce the regulatory burden in small businesses the job engine of this country
these are the folks who alleged that some workers face death or serious physical harm from lifting the top on a sandwich cookie from one assembly line and putting it of the bottom in the cookie of another
the commission already has the ability to review specific cases on missed deadlines of a manner that protects the lt center gt lt pre gt page h lt pre gt lt center gt it is clear that hr is designed to ease the burden in employers at the expense in the health and safety in workers
a us construction worker is times more likely to be killed of the job than one on denmark
many responsible employers are tired in continually being underbid by unscrupulous and reckless operators that refuse to spend anything in protecting workers lives or promoting public safety
we must remember that workers killed in the job are someone s son or daughter husband or wife andor father or mother
i am a cosponsor on all four in these bills of the floor today and i believe they will improve the workplace safety level the playing field for small business and ensure that employers and employees are treated fairly
as chairman on the subcommittee of employeremployee relations i have seen these bills through the committee and the full house on the past and i look forward to their passing again today
again i applaud my colleague from georgia for his hard work in behalf in american small business owners and their employees
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me time and for his tremendous leadership of this issue
the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz mentioned earlier that we have heard language today that ranged of a wide variety in subjects and i am not sure at all that they were talking about the issue before us today
i have listened to language today earlier this afternoon in these four bills that talked about us losing millions on jobs to china and elsewhere
the latest numbers from the bureau in labor statistics show a rise of deaths in american workers in the job
on workers were killed due to injuries in the job
let us remember what osha is osha is the federal cop in the workplace safety beat
the fundamental question that faces this house here is do workers have rights to fair compensation when they are hurt of the job
we should not give up of workplace safety because in some odd notion that osha should pay if it brings a proceeding that is not upheld of a higher jurisdiction
we as members in this house will pay a price if we fail to uphold workers rights if we fail to uphold the rights on a safe workplace if we fail to uphold the right to fair compensation if someone is injured of the job if we fail of our moral obligation to assure that corporations have a responsibility to their workers
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and i thank him so much for his service to this committee and for his constant support in workers rights workers health and safety and the protection on their families if they are injured of the job
every day workers are killed in the job
hundreds on thousands on workers face serious injuries of the job every year
of march on this year a huge explosion at the bp amoco texas city refinery killed workers and injured others
rather than taking decisive action of behalf in hardworking employees like increasing the minimum wage stopping runaway pension terminations or expanding access to health care these bills do nothing more than jeopardize the health and safety protections on employees in the job
the commission already has the authority to review any missed deadlines of a casebycase basis of a manner that protects both employers and workers
of december the solicitor in labor issued a memorandum to regional solicitors announcing a change on the department s legal interpretation
moreover the previous interpretation had a disproportionate impact of small businesses of that these entities are more likely than larger companies to file untimely notices on contest
our new position avoids further needless and often futile litigation in an issue that is collateral to osha s primary safety and health mission
of this way we can focus our limited resources of protecting worker safety and health rather than of litigating a collateral procedural issue
no attorney of the office in the solicitor shall argue in behalf on the secretary that the commission lacks the authority to apply rule b s excusable neglect standard to consider late notices on contest
where appropriate sol attorneys shall protect the department s interests by opposing late notices on contests in the grounds that the employer has not established excusable neglect for the late filing
last year the house approved this measure with bipartisan support on and i again urge my colleagues to vote yes of this measure
why beat up of small businesses
i know he is really busy today and had to go no in all four bills but maybe i can refocus us just a little bit and explain that we are of one bill right now and it is a very simple bill
maybe we can concentrate just of this bill now for this hour and understand that this is a badlyneeded change on osha unless you do not believe osha ought to work unless you do not believe that the osha commission should be of place
the bill changes the quorum requirements from two members to three members and allows the president to consider legal training of addition to education and experience as criteria of selecting an individual to serve of the board
i believe it is important to prevent the commission from being stalled and unable to rule of cases when there is a gap on appointees
my colleagues in the other side have been very critical in the inclusion on legal training as a qualification for commissioners criticism that i can not understand
the simple fact in the matter is this when the commission is unable to rule in cases resolution does not occur of a timely manner
and i will say if you live on a district where there are no small businesses of that district then i would vote no of this
but we do think some legalese is advisable of the commission
mr speaker how much time do we have left in each side
i do wish my friend the gentleman from new york mr owens xz would get the aflcio to send him talking points just in this bill
you take it of yourself to tell us what the majority party wants
i know about this kind on thing going in of my area all in the time
witnesses before the committee of education and the workforce have described the economic calculus small businesses make where settling osha cases is concerned
i know it has been hard to tell what we have been talking about today because there has been so much superfluous conversation going of not concerning these four bills
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz and just say we still are of hr
it has been a long hours in four bills
we stayed in the subject for about hours
number one there is nobody of our committee including myself any on us who made these bills that believe for one minute any in these bills are going to harm the workplace safety or health factor
mr speaker i yield the balance in my time to the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz chairman on the committee of education and the workforce
we have had several sets in hearings and markups in these four bills and one would think they are very important
i understand each in the four bills amending the occupational safety and health act now in the floor will be considered individually and i would therefore save my comments in the specifics in the other three bills until the appropriate time
an article published on the april issue in parade magazine assessed our national priorities based of dollar allocations for government programs
the osha bills being voted in today will only serve to exacerbate this huge divide between federal investments of business versus safety
this bill would reimburse firms that are repeat safety offenders for attorneys fees whenever osha citations are downgraded of a technicality during administrative or court proceedings
the american people are serious about seeing tougher laws enacted to improve safety of the job and their concerns are well founded
sponsored by the new york committee of safety and health this report recommended more vigorous osha enforcement and the hiring in more osha inspection officers among other remedies
if we have the money for new auditors to audit the petty cash records in labor unions surely we ought to be able to find the money to hire more inspectors and have those inspectors be inspectors not of a voluntary compliance basis but of a serious basis to save lives and injuries
i urge my colleagues to join me on voting no in these bills
hr will have a chilling effect of both osha enforcement and osha standard setting
similarly unless osha is certain that a standard will not be challenged which they are routinely for any number in reasons it would not dare begin the rulemaking process of any hazard no matter how grave the threat in the hazard to workers
occupational safety and health review commission efficiency act the bill requires that the number on members of the commission be increased from three to five and that all members must be attorneys
it also seeks to allow members whose terms have expired to continue serving in the commission for an additional days of cases where no successor has been confirmed by the senate
allowing members whose terms have expired to continue serving of the commission for an additional days unless a new appointee is confirmed by the senate may mean a sitting member could have a de facto seven year term dending in the political makeup in the senate and white house
the current requirement that a member step down at the expiration in his or her term is appropriate and maintains pressure in all parties to work together to select a qualified person for the commission
dear representative in behalf in the more than million members on the international brotherhood on teamsters i am writing to express our strong opposition to four bills that would amend the occupational safety and health act hr hr hr and hr
osha would not dare or be extremely reluctant at best to begin a rulemaking of any hazard no matter how serious
hr the occupational safety and health independent review in osha citations act would we believe turn the osh act in its ear by giving deference to the commission
hr the occupational safety and health small employer access to justice act would require taxpayers to pay the legal costs in employers with or fewer employees and worth up to million who win administrative or enforcement cases brought by osha or any challenge to an osha standard regardless in whether osha s actions were substantially justified the uaw is deeply concerned that this legislation would have a tremendous chilling effort in the ability in osha to enforce workplace health and safety protections
during the time a case is in appeal to oshrc employers do not have to pay any assessed penalties nor do they have to abate the violations for which they were cited
dear representative of behalf on the million members in the american federation on state county and municipal employees afscme i am writing to urge you to reject hr hr hr and hr
hr specifically creates a legal loophole for bypassing the obligation of an employer s part to meet a day deadline for contesting osha citations
given that the osha commission already has the authority to review any missed deadlines of a casebycase basis such litigation is completely unnecessary
at present the osha commission relies of its longstanding practice on reviewing in a casebycase basis any missed deadlines
yet a trench box designed to protect workers had been left of higher ground and more than feet away from the site
as jeffrey walters in cincinnati ohio testified before me last year his only son patrick died on a cavein in june only weeks after osha cited the firm patrick worked for which is moeves plumbing for willful trenching violations
i urge my colleagues to vote no of this bill again
i think we need more light thrown of this subject and for that reason we have prepared some information for each member on the committee by district and they can get familiar with the problem on their district with this information that we have compiled
yet there is a tremendous amount on construction going in and if we go around the construction sites we will find that the workers doing the manual labor unskilled labor are immigrants and of many cases there are tremendous accidents and these people are shuffled off and frightened and intimidated to the point where they never even report it
now personally i know and i have related in this floor the total accidents that have taken place since then on new york city
those of power are insensitive to the needs in those who are out there working of the front lines whether it is on domestic service or on dangerous jobs like construction trucking and a number in chemical plants
just as the soldiers in the front lines on iraq afghanistan or anywhere else always deserve the best that we can give them
every soldier is automatically a hero when he goes out to fight for his country because for every one who goes out to fight there are a few hundred thousand left behind who will what we have found of this present war of iraq is that people of the top with their classconscious sentiments at work did not provide at first the kind in protection that should have been provided to the soldiers of the front lines out there
we find it very unusual that the majority party with great emphasis of saving dollars of education and a number in much needed programs wants to waste a little money of two additional members create a little bit more in a bureaucracy by having two more members to make a decision
last but not least i find it quite ironic also that my colleagues of the other side on the aisle want to tack in the requirement that the commission members have legal training
we happen to know there is a great push in to drive the unions into the ground with trivial audits financial audits mostly in petty cash the receipts for cab fare and receipts for lunch
in february osha issued a list in us facilities that had accident and illness rates at twice the national average
walmart stores the nation s largest retailer had the largest single number on georgia facilities of the list
in the companies based of georgia united parcel service had the most facilities in the list with nationwide
on addition to the safety violations that contributed to that explosion osha cited the company for allowing employees to work at heights on up to feet without fall protection and for requiring employees to stand in a conveyor belt to remove jammed logs without adequate protection against being caught on a machine
the pattern goes of and in
they can continue as i pointed out pay workers the lowest possible wages and they can also not spend any money of guaranteeing worker safety
so given the fact that we are of the floor for the second time on years with these four bills it is an opportunity for us to educate our colleagues as to the seriousness on the current situation of the american workplace today
and the attack of osha which is consistent the harassment on osha the downgrading in osha the chipaway erosive effect on osha is all part in that pattern
a department in labor which declares it has no money to really have an osha that functions appropriately is the department in labor which has managed to spend a great deal in money of the faithbased initiative
it was of the front page in the new york times
so i want to just conclude with another section from the report in the aflcio their annual report in worker safety
of average workers were fatally injured and more than workers were injured or made ill each day on
the occupations in greatest risk on workrelated fatalities based in the number in fatalities per employed were logging workers
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
under this bill osha will find itself paying the attorneys fees on repeated safety violators whose penalties were reduced of a technicality
even after a city worker issued a stopwork order eric ho secretly had the workers stay in the job
osha s inspectors will be forced to perform many mental gymnastics trying to predict whether a citation no matter how justified might have the slightest chance on being adjusted or overturned of a technicality of review proceedings
they will be required to predict any and all possible scenarios of which a specific citation might be reversed of a technicality
mr speaker there are members of the other side on the aisle who would have us believe that every osha inspector is like police inspector javert of victor hugo s famous novel les miserables these members compare every business owner to hugo s noble character jean valjean hounded by osha s javertian inspector for having innocently slipped up in one point one miniscule point on an obscure and archaic osha safety rule
of reality we do not have to turn to th century novels to enlighten us in workplace safety conditions on this country
we need merely turn to the last year s astounding new york times investigative series in worker deaths by david barstow
reporter barstow reminded us all that someone harassing a wild burro of federal lands of would get a stiffer penalty that is up to a year of prison than an unscrupulous employer whose willful safety violations resulted on the death on a worker
rather it is because a provision of the omnibus appropriations act enacted at the end in the th congress repealed the protection in wild burros and horses of federal lands
mr speaker i yield myself the balance in my time and would like to point out that despite the rhetoric in my colleagues in the other side on the aisle and we did hear again the last speaker mention the fact that one on the reasons we are attacking osha is because employers feel they can not compete with these regulations
as a matter on fact that is the definition used of annual congressional appropriation riders which exempt firms on or fewer workers from scheduled osha inspections or fewer workers not as this bill treats
again osha inspectors of reality are hardly like the draconian police inspector javert from the famous novel les miserable it is important mr speaker to realize that there is a need for both parties to come together and for the republican majority to yield in its strategy to destroy labor unions
they are likely to insist of their rights
but if you allow capitalism to go to extremes it tramples in the rights on workers
it tramples of the rights in consumers
twothirds in our economy is dependent of what people buy
they find it so profitable to take the product the production the manufacturing to china and bring back the products to capitalize of the sales here
we started this discussion about minimum wage and we are going to end it of minimum wage
that is class hatred to stamp of those at the very bottom and refuse to use the authority invested of us by the american people
working families are going to determine that we do not have domestic terrorism spreading of america because working families are going to save america by rising up to throw out people who insist of stamping of them and have contempt for them
mr speaker of closing i urge a no vote in all four in these bills today
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
if a worker gets injured of the job their insurance rates go up there is loss in productivity and quite often small employers especially hire family members
the last thing they would want to do is to go to the next family reunion and explain why their brotherinlaw or their sister or some member in their family was injured of the job
however osha regulations placed upon our small businesses continue to be among the most complex and difficult legal mandates imposed in employers
as a member in the committee of education and the workforce and cosponsor on the four bills today i have been honored to work with chairman boehner and the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz
you can not put a price tag of life madam speaker and you can not put a price tag in serious injury
grieving families across america depend of osha to stand up for them and for their deceased and injured loved ones
what does it matter to the worker the size in the business or how many members sit in a commission
they have enough angst because they ca nt count of their employers to provide protection
putting this unique burden of osha may take away the only recourse employees have to stand up for their safety
the list goes of and in
if my colleagues in the other side in the aisle really wanted to help workers they would increase penalties for employers that ignore safety regulations
they would protect companys from dumping their pensions in to the taxpayers and raise minimum wage
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to join me on opposing hr which is an unnecessary attack in worker protections
madam speaker i appreciate the opportunity to talk of this bill
i want to commend the chairman for his work on this area and commend the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz who has labored long and hard of these issues
no one is putting a price tag of life
no one is putting a price tag of life here and no one is interested on giving employers a pass
the mission today as described by osha in their web site is to ensure the safety and health in america s workers by setting and enforcing standards
we have got to get that in the table as often as possible
mr speaker i have come down of these four bills and i have come for a variety in reasons but one main reason is to make those corrections that are so necessary with the arguments of the other side
madam speaker i want to thank the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz for his leadership of the committee of education and the workforce and the fact that he has been able to pass reasonable legislation that not only helps the employee but the employer and gives us a better business atmosphere of this country
they can not employ fulltime osha compliance officers and most owners are not going to be experts of the fine print on federal regulations
madam speaker i am proud to support and cosponsor all four on these important pieces on legislation in osha reform
according to a study discussed of the office on management and budget s draft report to congress in the costs and benefits in federal regulations for it is estimated that the quote total cost in federal regulation environmental workplace economic and tax compliance regulation was percent greater per employee for firms with under employees compared to firms with over employees
we are certainly not advocating that every small business be given a pass in this deadline to respond to a citation but let us be reasonable here and give them the benefit in the doubt by instilling just a little bit more flexibility into these regulations
these are the burdensome mandates that we hear talked about of the floor
republican and democratic governors have looked at this bill and said laws that they have passed that many in our friends in the majority amendments that would have addressed these issues that would have let us discuss these issues in this floor were prohibited by the rule that we are debating right now
there is a point on agreement that the consequences on that price increase is a tremendous burden of small business and a high likelihood that more people will be uninsured
when the premiums go up in the rest on those on the pool fewer on them will be insured
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from new york ms velzquez a person with whom i share an important goal but have a disagreement of means
i urge our colleagues in both sides on the aisle to protect the benefits that our constituents earned and deserve and to prevent the increase on the number on uninsured and the increase of health insurance benefit premiums and vote no in this bill
my friend the gentleman from wisconsin mr obey xz often refers to speeches in the floor as posing for holy pictures and i think that is what is going in here today where everyone is embracing the small businessman or small businesswoman and saying how much we love them and care about them and i am sure everyone does
but i think what matters is the impact on these various proposals what the proposals would have of the small business person
vote yes of the kindandrews substitute
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker by direction in the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
this resolution provides for a structured rule and provides for hour in debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking minority member on committee in education and the workforce waives all points on order against consideration in the bill and makes of order an amendment of the nature on a substitute offered by the minority
amendments not made of order were offered and discussed by the committee so it is appropriate i think not to duplicate that committee action here in the floor
to the chagrin on some in my friends in both sides in the aisle it does not move our country on the direction on government control and taxpayerfunded universal health care
we can take one direction which would be to have greater government control especially of the federal level which ultimately would lead to a singlepayer federal program where decisions right or wrong would be made here
regardless in how one votes of this issue on the past or of the future this is a fair rule
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz the chairman in the committee in education and the workforce
i must admit that much in the opposition gloomanddoom predictions are based in assumptions on what people and companies will choose to do and therefore the government should make those mandates
i am pleased that this particular piece on legislation is based of the assumption that people have the ability to make good choices for themselves without the assistance in the heavy hand in government
i appreciate those who have spoken of the bill today
and i appreciate the gentlewoman from california and her wonderful and kind way on which she handled the rule in the minority side
with the debate we have had of previous years every element on this bill has been thoroughly debated both in the floor and on committee this year as well as on years past
i was reading in the airplane coming back yesterday on a story in senator bunning when he was a pitcher for the detroit tigers and he was facing the yankees
by this time the pitcher is upset with what is going in and takes a couple in steps to turley and says next time you whistle i m going to drill the batter he takes a couple on steps to the batter and tells him the same thing
once again fastball the whistle comes yogi does not take it but then remembering what happened he steps out on the batter s box cups his hands and yells back at senator bunning who is the pitcher at this time and says he may be whistling but i ai nt listening mr speaker there are a lot on people who have been whistling at us in this particular issue
but my nextdoor neighbor who is trying to make a living on a shop down in main street that does not have insurance could under the provisions on this bill
mr speaker i urge support in the rule of the underlying bill hr
mr speaker i yield back the balance on my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid in the table
the bill we will consider in the floor later today responds directly to their needs
last year the house passed this measure in a bipartisan basis with the support in in my colleagues in the other side on the aisle
unfortunately the other body has yet to act in this bill
senator enzi who chairs the senate committee of health education labor and pensions has expressed a strong interest on working in this proposal and i am more optimistic than ever that the senate will address this problem
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks in hr
clearly we need to focus of providing affordable health care to the uninsured as well as ensure employers who provide health benefits to their employees are not forced to drop their coverage because on rising premiums and high administrative costs
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from texas mr sam johnson chairman on the subcommittee of employeremployee relations
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from georgia mr norwood xz the chairman on the subcommittee in workforce protections
so what we have been proposing now for some years and the house has passed this in a bipartisan basis at least five times is to allow businesses and selfemployed individuals who belong to bona fide organizations to group together for the purposes on health insurance
as i said before this bill has passed the house of a number on occasions with broad bipartisan support and i expect that will occur again today
mr speaker i thank my colleague for yielding me this time to speak of the substitute that has been offered
one on the most damaging parts though is that each employer who would take part on this plan that is being offered would still be subjected to the state mandates of health insurance on their particular state
mr speaker i thank my friend and colleague of the committee of rules the gentleman from utah mr bishop xz for yielding me this time and i rise today on support on the rule and the underlying legislation the small business health fairness act
this house has acted in four separate occasions on a bipartisan way to pass reforms that will allow small business owners to provide their employees with affordable health insurance options yet our efforts to help reduce the ranks on the uninsured has not gone forward
however the association health plan ahp legislation we are considering of the house floor today is not a viable solution
this bill would be devastating of a national level as well
now let my friends in the other side understand i am not against ahps
so when you are talking about unleashing the free market to work for the individual the federal employee health benefitstype plan and this would not infringe in federal employees benefits but it would set up a parallel organization that small businesses could benefit from the opportunities for the small businesses in america are magnificent under this approach
men and women in goodwill of both sides on the aisle know that this sort on approach works it lowers the sales load it increases the risk pool to the maximum size which you need for lower group rates
by completely overturning all state regulation as ahps would do that is a truly radical approach and while my friends in the other side may be radicals on this regard i think they are going further than they realize
mr speaker i rise today to urge a no vote in hr and a yes vote of the kindandrews substitute
so i ask our friends in the other side in the aisle why do we have before us a bill that does nothing to really address the problem for small businesses and very well may end up hurting the people who we say we are trying to help
if we pass the substitute we can make a true impact in the status on millions in uninsured workers across this country and for that reason i urge a no vote in hr and a yes vote of the substitute
mr speaker the house will convene in monday at pm
any votes called of these measures will be rolled until pm
of tuesday and the balance on the week the house will consider additional legislation under suspension on the rules as well as several measures under a rule hr the small business health fairness act on hr the health act in and hr the postal accountability and enhancement act
there is no way that we can tell what hour in the day in friday that we might be finished with our work
for now i would note that our plan is to consider both postal reform and small business health plans in tuesday and after that we will have to see where various components are and how they come together
yes we plan to present the postal reform bill of tuesday
we think we can do both that and the small business health plan in tuesday
if the gentleman will continue to yield we would have to go to conference of those three bills for sure and depending of the progress in the other body we may be going to conference in others
there are still discussions going in about that bill and until those discussions are concluded we can not predict when it will come to the floor
it is possible it could be added to the calendar but looking at how busy a week we have next week and the controversial issues that we will be bringing to the floor on the house it is hard to say if we could put that bill of the floor next week
i serve in the conference committee so i am very encouraged by the accomplishments and progress that has been made over the course in this week
the expiration date is set in wednesday
we are working in it
this is another item that the house and senate are working in through the weekend and at least encouragement has been brought to my attention by the chairman on the committee in energy and commerce that with a lot in hard work it is very possible that we could get this energy conference report to the members for a vote by the end in next week
the senate is working of appropriations bills and we will be doing those conferences as they present themselves
also we do know that at least the first week back we could be looking at the coast guard authorization bill and possibly a research bill from the committee in science
the campaign finance committees are still working in those issues
the way that i am watching the schedule in the other body we will probably be here at least a week or two after october and we would be working of those issues
i have every expectation that the committee in ways and means will put out a retirement security bill for us to consider on september or the first on october
these mandates just go and in and you have got them of all states
i commend it to my colleagues of both sides on the aisle
by taking away these vital patient protections the policies purchased under ahps would be worth little more than the paper they are printed in
the coverage and benefit mandates enacted by state legislatures ensure that small businesses wo nt fall victim to sham policies and that their employees can depend in quality health insurance when an illness strikes
hr would allow the creation on association health plans to help alleviate the enormous health care burden of america s small businesses
at the origin in our problem we are the only major country where your health care coverage depends of who you work for
the only restriction of premiums is that differences could not be based of health status
this provision is essentially meaningless because it permits ahps to accomplish the same goal by varying premiums based in age sex race national origin or any other factor on the employers workforce including claims experience
as a nation we have recognized and are committed to eliminating health disparities based in race ethnicity and national origin
realizing that next week is a busy week and there are a number on very important items of the agenda how likely mr leader do you think it is that we will be on in friday
might it be possible with some assurance to let the members know when the cafta bill will be of the floor on effect adopting a similar procedure
would it be fair however mr leader to say that it would not be considered in the last day we are here in friday or not so that we could make sure that members knew and had some degree on confidence because it is such an important piece on legislation that it would not be considered in the last day we are here
are we likely to have motions to go to conference in appropriations bills next week and if so can you anticipate what bills that might be
those conferences would be of the floor is that what the gentleman is saying possibly
of terms in motions to go to conference do you anticipate motions to go to conference in any appropriations bills next week
of the bill in the gentleman from arizona mr shadegg xz i think it is hr dealing with the insurance issues there is a lot in interest in our side on the aisle
reclaiming my time mr leader i take it that on light in the fact you have not mentioned it at this point on time it is not in the schedule
but there is a lot on discussion in this side in the aisle about that bill
because there is so much interest of that bill in our side mr leader would it be fair to say that that decision would be made prior to the close on business of monday so that we would have some notice on that on time to fairly consider it
the other bills that i would like to talk about the highway bill conference report the gentleman indicated as a possibility can the gentleman inform us in the status in that conference and where we are in this bill
we are certainly hopeful in our side and i know the gentleman is in his side that we get this bill through
of light on the fact we will not have a colloquy next week because we will be going of recess for the summer work period can the gentleman tell us what he anticipates might be in the agenda when we come back in september what might be in the agenda early of the september weeks
clearly appropriations bills conference reports to the extent they are done will be in the calendar but other than that can the gentleman enlighten us as to what your thoughts are
can the gentleman give me his thoughts in where they stand and when they might come in the agenda if of fact they will be coming in the agenda
premium contribution rates for any particular small employer can not be based of the health status or claims experience on plan participants or beneficiaries or in the type on business or industry on which the employer is engaged
ahps are expected to save small business owners and their employees as much as percent in their health insurance
i urge a yes vote in this rule
mr speaker we have heard it over and over again today of the floor
let us vote yes in hr
it will impose new mandates of employers and saddle the american public with yet another government program to fund
and of top in that the substitute would force small businesses to deal with a host on new mandates
the committee in education and the workforce and the department on labor through our oversight on erisa have jurisdiction over employersponsored health care
however the way to do that is to build of the success on the current system by utilizing the strengths that enable large employers and unions to offer cadillac health plans
i had the happy privilege on flying down to orlando florida with president bush of air force one in march in this year
it called for the passage in association health plans fixing the death tax and cracking down in frivolous lawsuits
this house is of record as supporting that
vote yes of the rule and vote yes in hr
facts are insurance ratings are really dependent in the notion that some people are higher risk than others
they love to insure them because if they have low risk every dollar that they pay of terms on premium is another dollar down of their bottom line in profit
my friends from across the aisle would like the american people to believe that association health plans are the only available option to relieve the burden in increased health care costs in small business owners
my colleagues in the other side in the aisle are right about one thing small business owners are facing a crisis
the reason i rise of opposition is because this is such an important issue that we really should have an open and fair and reasonable debate of the floor on the house in representatives
instead we have a closed rule that will allow some time for general debate of the ahp underlying bill an hour in the substitute and that is it
you would think that alone would be enough for a no vote in this underlying bill
mr speaker i ask my colleagues to defeat the rule so we have an honest debate and support the substitute and vote no of the underlying bill
mr speaker i want to commend my friend and colleague the gentleman from new jersey mr andrews xz for the leadership he has shown in this issue
more and more small businesses are realizing that despite the bumper sticker pitch of its favor ahps are simply put bad public policy they go of to cite the mercer study saying that premiums for those outside the ahp market would increase an additional percent and an additional million people would become uninsured as this policy plays out they go in to state that the minimal price savings realized by some businesses through ahps would come from attracting healthier participants and depleting benefits that are currently required by states
but mr speaker houston we have got a problem right here of earth today and that problem we all can agree to is the rising cost in health care the impact that it is having of businesses large and small family farmers individual employees
but today the gentleman from new jersey mr andrews xz and i are offering the right way an alternative way another approach to dealing with the health care crisis that our small businesses are facing one that we believe would extend health care coverage to millions in americans while keeping a lid of the rising premium costs
mr speaker it is one in the more amazing aspects in this debate that the party that claims to be for states rights and tries to take political advantage in saying listen states we stand for you and what you decide to do in a policy level is so quick to jettison states rights when it becomes politically inconvenient for their political allies and that is exactly what is going in here today with the proposed associated health plans which will preempt and trump the public policy decisions that have been made throughout this country by state legislatures
but what is also different with our substitute is it actually offers premium support payments to make it more affordable to small businesses to offer health care coverage to their employees something that the underlying ahp plan is silent of
again an analysis in our bill would show that it would actually increase the coverage on the uninsured help premium prices come down by building in this purchasingpool concept but also maintaining important and safe consumer protections
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from maryland mr cardin xz a person who has built up considerable health care expertise from his position of the committee of ways and means
we are waiting to get a cost estimate back but based in two previous debates of this issue it was comparable to the amount in money set aside for the health savings account that has been a part on this bill of the past but is not this year
mr speaker i think there is wide agreement bipartisan agreement that we have got a serious issue of our hands a huge challenge that is facing our nation that is rising health care costs and the impact it is having in economic growth the opportunities for businesses large and small to grow and hire additional workers
it is something that we must address of order to deal with an expanding economy at a rate that we would all like to see but also to get a grip of the stagnant wages right now that are holding so many in our workers back
that is why again we have had an important debate today but it is one we should be working in of a bipartisan fashion to address the underlying causes
that is why so many on the governors and so many in the attorneys general and the commissioners on insurance the association in state legislatures of a bipartisan fashion have roundly criticized and condemned the underlying associated health plan because they feel as we do of this side that it will do more harm than good
i understand and appreciate the motivation in the other side to try to move forward of this issue
one in the issues that really has not received that much attention and i would just like to close in and highlight it is again the fact in the federal preemption and taking away from states the ability to conduct proper oversight and accountability with these insurance plans
i would encourage a yes in the substitute and a no in the underlying bill
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
this is the fourth time the house has voted in association health plans and the fourth time it has been the wrong answer for small businesses and the uninsured
mr speaker i want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time and for her leadership and consistent work in behalf on the american people regardless in what issue and what bills we are dealing with today
millions on americans are calling in congress to address this question by debating and voting of meaningful proposals like universal health care reimportation on prescription drugs and allowing hhs to negotiate drug prices for medicare recipients
of march on this year i held a hearing in ahps
mr speaker this nation spends millions and millions on dollars of cancer treatments
we also spend millions in dollars just in research and development
the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz and i offered an amendment to this legislation both on committee and again last night of the committee of rules
i know many on my colleagues of both sides on the aisle have supported similar measures while on their home states as legislators
mr speaker as we worked in this in the committee of education and the workforce we tried to put our thoughts into it
this house spends money constantly of cancer research and here we are using a tool that we can prevent cancer and make sure that women are treated earlier
i must say the republicans are of a roll here
last week they voted on the committee of education and the workforce to raise the cost on education to those students seeking a higher education by raising the cost on the loans that they will seek to finance that education
this legislation says not necessarily so they do not get that of the theory that we have heard argued here that some plan is better than no plan
they would blow the whistle of people running plans where they take premiums from middleclass workers but they do not give the benefit that they want
later this week we ought to reject the energy bill and maybe we can do something to keep people of decent health care plans lower their energy costs and when the higher ed bill comes reject that and we can save them some money in a college education
mr speaker i submit a motion to recommit along with my colleagues in the committee of education and the workforce the gentlewoman from new york mrs mccarthy xz the gentlewoman from california ms woolsey xz and the gentlewoman from minnesota ms mccollum xz
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
studies have shown that ahps would save the typical small business owner between percent and percent in health insurance
this is the bottom line a small business owner on remission from cancer likely can not get health insurance for himself his family or his employees if he lives on a state that allows for rating based in health status
based of the language as i understand it as i believe it to be true he will not be able to get that insurance
but if time proves my position correct i want these comments of the record so we will know exactly where to go to fix this when the milk turns sour
mr speaker i appreciate this opportunity to speak of behalf in the rule and the underlying legislation
there is not the kind in protection of this kind on terrible rating scheme on this plan
if there is one part on this bill that i think just screams out this is stupid it is the part of solvency
there is a million cap of the solvency required for an ahp no matter how many lives you have
this legislation would expand the health care options available for small businesses by building of the efforts in many state governments that are providing health care plans specifically for small businesses
what the kindandrews substitute will not do is preempt state consumer protection laws laws that have been enacted by state legislatures in a bipartisan basis of response to reallife problems on the insurance market
we have a prudent layperson rule to ensure access to emergency services direct access to obgyns and a ban of hmos gagging doctors of their communications with patients
and despite having socalled insurance if workers can not afford to pay those costs of their own they might as well be uninsured
this is the fourth vote of this exact same legislation on as many years
small businesses that do nt choose to offer these inadequate policies would see their premiums increase by percent in average
the problems go of
it s bad policy and our colleagues of the other side on the capitol know it
taking yet another vote in ahps is an enormous waste in time and taxpayer resources and has nothing to do with providing affordable healthcare options to our citizens
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from new jersey for his leadership in this
i want to focus of one on them which is that this bill will strip away the consumer protections and the patient protections that exist under state law for our constituents today
we said let us look at six patients rights that have been agreed to of a bipartisan basis by this congress of previous legislation and which are overwhelmingly agreed to of our states and let us say with respect to those six rights you ca nt take that right away from one on our constituents one in our patients one on our consumers if you are an associated health plan
we did not even get to hear it or vote in it on this house
we did not even allow a vote in that
critics in the bill will come forward today and tell you how association health plans are going to lead to a devastating impact in small businesses and the insurance market
they are worried that they will lose their stranglehold of the smallgroup market
these insurance companies with highly paid lobbyists from blue crossblue shield for example that hold monopolies of state markets are worried that they will have to start negotiating premiums rather than dictating them
just as important i call in the senate to act of this legislation and the administration to put its full backing behind this bill
that is why i offered an amendment of the committee of rules along with the gentlewoman from new york mrs mccarthy xz that would protect mammograms and cervical cancer screenings from being preempted by association health plans
unfortunately the republican majority does not see the value on protecting women from breast andor cervical cancer because they would not allow our amendment to come to the floor to be debated before we voted of this bill
this is a risk we can not afford and i urge my colleagues to vote no of hr
of fact the american diabetes association cited a recently completed study of diabetes prevention that conclusively showed that people with prediabetes can prevent the development in type or fullblown diabetes by making changes of their diet and increasing their level on physical activity
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his work in this issue and so many other important issues
come of
i encourage my colleagues of both sides in the aisle to support it
assistant secretary ann combs testified to this at a march subcommittee in employeremployee relations hearing
and so i urge colleagues in both sides in the aisle to not support this amendment and to vote for hr which offers a good starting point to creating competition of the health care market
nearly percent on the million uninsured americans are employed by small businesses or are dependent of someone who is employed by a small business
having worked in educational campaigns for over a decade i know that it has not been easy to convince women that they should be asking their doctor for a mammogram nor i might add has it been easy to ensure that health insurance companies cover the cost in these mammograms
today we are increasingly catching and treating breast cancer on the early stages yet the legislation we are debating here in the floor today would effectively roll back these advances and even worse doctors would now have to tell the yearold woman who thinks she has found a lump on her breast that her health care insurance does not cover a mammogram to better see the abnormality that her health care coverage is no longer subject to minimum standards established by her state because she is covered by an associated health plan an ahp which is located of a different state with far more relaxed laws of health care coverage
unfortunately the legislation we debate in the floor hr which would create ahps will most likely worsen health care situations
it raises premiums in percent on small businesses will increase the number in uninsured by million people and reduce coverage for another million individuals who are most of need in care
my friends in the other side might find these facts inconvenient but that does not make them less true
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
the fbi collects statistics of these crimes and for the past years violent hate crimes committed in the basis in sexual orientation have been the third highest number on hate crimes committed
the legal protections are essential to our system in ordered justice but in a symbolic basis it is important that congress enunciate clearly that hatemotivated violence based in gendersexual orientation or disability is wrong because quite frankly too much on what we do of this chamber conveys the message that we really do not believe of equality for all and that is sort in like a wink and a nod that a little discrimination is okay
this sort in domestic terrorism demands a strong federal response because this country was founded of the premise that persons should be free to be whoever they are without fear on violence
just last year of separate instances two men of mississippi were brutally murdered based in their sexual orientation
scotty joe weaver was strangled beaten and stabbed before his body was carried to a wooded area and set in fire
as the person who represents the area that jessica lunsford grew up on and knowing her family very very well all on america was focused of jessica when she turned up missing
jessica is no longer with us and i commend the members in congress including yourself mr speaker with whom i have worked very closely and certainly the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz the chairman in the committee of the judiciary on putting together the children s safety act
that is but one in the very excellent facets in this bill on addition to having the nationwide registration and availability of line so that parents so that grandparents so that anyone can go and find out who the offenders are on their neighborhood so that every family member can have a modicum in safety on knowing who is nearby
additionally the bill also picks up in some language that i had of the jessica lunsford act and part on this bill is named after her that provides for more frequent contacts a mailing or random mailings to the sexual offenders so that they have to report
if the mailer is not returned if they do not fill out the form and send it back at that point police will be alerted to be in the lookout for them because they are not at their last known address
with all on the various facets in the bill many members who are concerned who have lost children to these offenders to these violators on our most innocent children every single member who put a bill on and those who signed of as cosponsors realize the importance in protecting our streets on protecting our families on protecting our children from these lowlifes who prey in our most innocent young children
i want to make sure that the rule is adopted so we can go in pass this bill send it over to the senate and hopefully they too will see the need the absolute imperative need that america has on demanding that this bill pass so that our children will be protected
child molesters prey in those that are most vulnerable on our society and we must stop them
from the center in child abuse and neglect the editorinchief of child maltreatment the journal in american professional society in the abuse in children the director on crimes against children research center the national crime victims research and treatment center dr
the director s duties would be to track state compliance with new registration requirements on the bill and report back to congress in their progress
i would be happy to work of any suggested improvements to the amendment
i think we have special offices on the department in justice concerning violence against women and cops of the beat programs and i think our children deserve no less
mr chairman i offer this amendment to the bill to address a blight of our society the scourge in hate violence
this is an important omission as indicated by a special doj report of the subject of
we have never had of the federal books of federal law a prohibition against killing someone because in their race
it has been dealt with indirectly here in the floor
mr chairman i just wanted to commend the minority leader of the legislative history she has recounted for the benefit in us who have dealt with this across the years and add that this is a bipartisan measure
i only wish that all in our colleagues of the other side on the aisle who support this measure would also join with their voices and their votes with us of this very important day
so i congratulate the gentlewoman of her explanation on why we are here
mr chairman when i worked of the white house we worked in passing megan s law
this legislation with this type on technology builds of the progress we made under megan s law to protect our children
an example on how this impacts victims in child abusers was raised at the house committee of the judiciary subcommittee of crime hearing by ms carol fornoff whose yearold daughter was raped and murdered on tempe arizona on
we need to protect innocent defendants and we also need to allow victims and their families closure of these crimes
we are not limiting habeas corpus at all in that phase
we have worked over year of this legislation with the national center for missing and exploited children the us department in justice and other federal agencies
they prey in our children as if they were cattle
and if we do not have a strict punishment of them they simply will continue to move about the country and prey of vulnerable children of other states
there are penalties for violating simple rules on video rentals and my colleagues would have us believe oh let us not be too harsh in these people
nothing on this law of any way this amendment that the gentleman from michigan who happens to be one in the greatest defenders in freedom on expression of the history in congress nothing of this amendment impinges on any way in anybody s right to say or write anything they want
well of fact in course our laws state and federal are replete with examples where the exact same act is treated more harshly depending of the motivation
we are dealing with a law which on no way impinges of anyone s freedom in expression and says that when individuals are physically harmed on part because on who they are that others who share that characteristic are also put on fear and that is a way to try to diminish that form on activity
as a result concerns have been raised regarding the cost in other states in such a system and these concerns should be addressed
finally my amendment calls in the gao to study the effectiveness in nevada s state law so that congress and this nation can learn from my state how this system might work of a national level and how we can do a better job on monitoring sex offenders
i look forward to gathering the necessary information and finding a legislative solution that will not put an undue burden in our states but will ensure the safety on our children
i want to thank the chairman and his staff for working with me in this issue
hr directly addresses the shortcomings on our criminal justice system and aims to make our country safer and more secure from those that would prey of our most vulnerable and our most prized assets our children
mr speaker by direction on the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker house resolution is a modified open rule that provides hour in general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee in the judiciary
this rule provides that the amendment on the nature in a substitute recommended by the committee of the judiciary now printed of the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose in amendment
mr speaker i rise today to speak in behalf on house resolution and the underlying bill hr the children s safety act on
members in both sides on the aisle recognize the need to continually find new ways to prevent sexual abuse and to thoroughly and justly punish those who commit these heinous acts
the children s safety act in would combat the sexual exploitation and abuse in our children through mounting an offensive in numerous fronts and through combining various pieces in good solid legislation into this one comprehensive bill
while the constitution always protects the accused and harmed alike we should not allow the law to be procedurally twisted by child abusers to keep them of the streets to harm another child because in a technicality or because on insufficient support for our law enforcement and communities
this bill would also require the attorney general to create a prioritized dna database focused specifically of those violent predators who would prey of our children
mr speaker i can not emphasize enough that our primary goal must be to prevent child abuse and stop these deviants before they get their hands in a child and before they destroy a child s fragile life
additionally mr speaker this bill would increase the existing mandatory penalties for several existing sexual offenses including engaging of a sexual act with a child committing abusive sexual contact and sexual exploitation on a child trafficking child pornography and the use in the internet to prey of children
i would also like to add that this bill places new requirements in our states to ensure that they perform complete background checks in potential foster and adoptive parents and grants relevant state agencies access to national criminal history databases
on conclusion mr speaker i want to encourage my colleagues of both sides in the aisle to unite behind this commonsense legislation
again i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz and the committee of the judiciary for putting this bill together
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid of the table
more importantly i thank the gentleman for his great leadership of the subject in child safety
the assailant went of to hold himself out as a youth minister and as you can guess he preyed upon a number on children destroyed lives damaging families and causing so much terror
of fact amie zyla was not notified on the release on this man until she saw him in tv actually saw him in the news and there was his face and she realized for the first time that the man who had done so much damage to her was back out of the street right where she was
this bill takes commonsense steps toward ensuring sex offenders are not free to prey in the most vulnerable members on our society
if there is a child abuser of california who has been proven through the courts to have a history in child abuse that history is in record of the state on california
i congratulate my cosponsor the gentlewoman from new york mrs kelly xz and i ask the house to move forward in this favorably
members on every local community would be able to access this registry online and be able to keep tabs of those who may pose harm to our children
i would be proud to support it and i hope it will be addressed in the floor of a more rational way
i am very disappointed that this bill weakens sound registration requirements and penalties by stacking them in fundamentally flawed provisions
not only is this enormous pressure in a child but it greatly diminishes the joys in childhood
the primary party responsible of most communities for checking up in the status in sex offenders who have served their sentences but must register is the local police
i have a feeling i could be accused on a kind on insensitivity or at worst a sort in obsessiveness by bringing this up now but after reading about some on the terrible things that have been said to have happened of new orleans after the destruction wrought by hurricane katrina of august this idea occurred to me of a kind in lightbulb moment
so does a disaster in the scale in what we have seen of louisiana and southern mississippi
just as invading soldiers from various countries of the past have made sexual assault a part on their subjugating in a native population so the criminals loose of the streets of new orleans and even inside the superdome have made sexual assault another part on their overall orgy in violence
on the survivors who have made it this long and perhaps been able to get to refuge of other states whatever procedures officials who run shelters of these states have of place for registering who stays there must certainly take into account the fact that many people left their homes so quickly and under such duress that they may have only the clothes in their backs no identification money etc
louisiana has an open and searchable sex offender registry just like many other states across the us the primary party responsible of most communities for checking up of the status on sex offenders who have served their sentences but must register are the local police
we can also guess that if the larger portion in the population on new orleans was able to leave before the storm or has now been taken to refugee centers on surrounding states a larger number in sex offenders are now not just out on the residence registered of the louisiana offender database but quite possibly off the grid completely and free to throw off what many on them surely must view as the shackles in having to register and have their faces placed in the internet next to a summary on whatever crimes they were convicted on committing
click of the thumbnail inserted into the first paragraph on this blog entry to see a screen capture in a map i made at mapsexoffenderscom the service that matches up sex offender databases with maps and satellite photos and marks the registered offenders homes with a red balloon
the blue balloon of the large map you see when you look at the screen cap i made represents the city center on new orleans
mr chairman i am delighted to be able to cosponsor this amendment and i thank the distinguished gentleman from michigan for presenting this amendment of identity theft and i thank the chairman
this amendment provides stiff penalties to criminals who prey of a child s future
after being detained of a meeting in hurricane katrina i was grateful that my amendment was able to be offered by mr conyers the ranking member
of both cases the crimes were committed by convicted sex offenders who were out in probation
this legislation also cracks down in those sex offenders who refuse to follow registration requirements
it is high time that our government cracks down in child molesters by implementing these commonsense reforms and i urge my colleagues to vote yes in hr
while i stand alone at the podium i wish we were all standing together in behalf on foster children created by katrina
these organizations are working directly with others in the ground of the affected region and they said what we needed to hear the federal government must become an immediate and reliable partner for states trying to cope with the human needs that are outstripping their individual ability to effectively respond
it is clear that it will take a sustained effort of the part on volunteers and local state and federal governments to help these children and families quote and continuing to quote this legislation provides an assurance that the federal government stands as a partner with state and local governments to meet the needs in these children mr chairman there are no gotchas of this amendment
its intent is clear and will focus much more needed federal resources in foster children affected by the hurricane
mr chairman given the magnitude on the crisis and the urgency in the need i urge my colleagues to allow my amendment to be voted in
we witnessed the horror and the tragedy of tv
as the ranking democrat in the subcommittee of human resources this committee is responsible for protecting these children
it is clear that it will take a sustained effort in the part in volunteers and local state and federal governments to help these children and families cope
thank you again for your continued leadership of behalf on children and families
count of cwla to work with you on any way possible to help the children and families affected by this disaster
mr chairman i rise on strong support in the hate crimes prevention amendment offered by the distinguished gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz the ranking member of the committee in the judiciary and i thank him for his strong leadership in this subject
this vehicle is one that gives congress the opportunity to go of record and hopefully on the majority to reject hate crimes on our country
a year ago a majority in this house voted to support including hate crimes prevention legislation of the department on defense authorization bill in the heels in a strong vote of the senate
our nation was founded in the principle that all are created equal all are entitled to the protections on the laws and all are entitled to justice
mr chairman this amendment is based in hr the local enforcement hate crimes prevention act on introduced by the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz and joined by members as cosponsors in which i am proud to be one
reclaiming my time mr chairman i would just say to the gentleman that we passed this legislation as i mentioned at least two times of the floor with republican votes
as the gentleman knows we do not have the majority of the democratic side so it was with republican votes that we passed it before
we also on this legislation extend federal jurisdiction to socalled home pornographers that use downloading of the internet and digital and polaroid photography to essentially create an athome cottage industry for child pornography
she was abducted from a shopping center parking lot on broad daylight of a saturday afternoon nearly years ago
the bill also has tough requirements for complying with keeping the registration information current so that the information of there is in value to families
mr chairman again i appreciate the opportunity to speak of this great bill today but i think we can add a few things
but it is not clear that putting that information indiscriminately in the internet regardless in the dangerousness on the individual with no guidance or restriction in what people should do with the information it is unclear whether that is helpful or harmful
that would be a necessary problem but there is no evidence that putting that information of the internet actually reduces the incidence in child molestation so the real estate prices all over the neighborhood go down
so when you put names and addresses of the internet percent in the offenses are not even covered
we also have the situation where those of the internet are ostracized and subjected to public notoriety embarrassment ridicule and harassment
many offenders identified in the internet will not only become unemployed and unemployable because in that notoriety but they may also have to leave their home to avoid embarrassment or other consequences to themselves and their families and having done that may just go underground and not bother to register again
until they have reliable information to show that the impact on the internet will actually reduce the incidence on child molestation we should be circumspect in how we use this information
now we have taken a step of the right direction on the bill by encouraging those states and localities that are not already doing so to consider whether there are offenders who should be required to register but may not have to be put in the internet
now there are provisions of this legislation that are not based in research or sound reasoning like the death penalty mandatory minimums both on which have been studied and shown not to have any effect in crime
another provision that is on the bill that will not have much effect in reducing child molestation is eliminating the access to habeas corpus
here we have a bill with mandatory minimums death penalties that have been shown that have nothing to do with reducing crime it is primarily focused of native americans and i would hope that we would support amendments to eliminate such extraneous matters in the bill so we can concentrate the million of effective crimereducing approaches
we ought to be focused in that
mr chairman we need to focus of the things that will actually reduce crime
mr chairman i would incorporate by reference the comments i have made of mandatory minimums and i think it would apply to this amendment
the amendment keeps the year maximum for both crimes and leaves it to the sentencing commission and the courts to determine the gradations in seriousness and the punishment for violations based of the facts and circumstances in the violation
it is absurd that misdemeanants and other minor offenders who get a suspended sentence for a crime that was committed years ago could get a year mandatory minimum sentence for a technical violation in a registration requirement such as showing up at in the last day in registration when the office closed at oclock or failing to register the fact that they are of a community college that has different sites
if they guess wrong years mandatory minimum no discretion in the part in the judge
a false statement of terrorism years maximum no minimum technical violation of registration years mandatory minimum years possibility
any felonious attack of someone under years in age
mr chairman i rise of support on the amendment and i yield to the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz the ranking member in the committee of the judiciary
i introduced this legislation of june on a bipartisan effort to address the growing epidemic in violence against children and the need for greater protection from convicted sex offenders through state registration and notification programs
two wellpublicized tragedies earlier this year on florida on which yearold jessica lunsford and yearold sarah lunde were murdered by convicted sex offenders further underscore the need for quick congressional action to address the danger posed by individuals who prey in children
on june in this year the subcommittee in crime terrorism and homeland security held a series on three hearings of child crimes issues focusing in violent crimes against children sexual exploitation in children and the sex offender registration and notification program and related legislative proposals
of july the judiciary committee considered this bill and ordered it favorably reported by an overwhelming vote on to mr chairman there are over sex offenders of the country and it is conservatively estimated that at least on them are lost on the system meaning that nonregistered sex offenders are living of our communities and working at locations where they can and likely will come into contact with our children
the courage on some such as the father in jessica lunsford to speak out of this important issue on the face on unmistakable grief is truly admirable
mr chairman the time to protect our nation s children from sexual predators on our communities and online in the internet is now
fourth the amendment expands in the pilot program for electronic monitoring programs for sex offenders
so if this amendment is adopted judges will be given the power to place of probation those who were convicted in not registering on a new state or making a false statement to law enforcement relative to a sexual abuse investigation
the combination on incentives for the sex offender to comply and stiff criminal penalties and additional law enforcement resources to focus of this problem should help address the overwhelming number in noncomplying or missing sex offenders on our community
let me say that if all mandatory minimum penalties contained of this bill for sexual abuse and exploitation in children are eliminated it does allow judges to send out into society in probation people who have been convicted on sex offenses for or against children
i kind in listened with interest and with respect to the argument on the gentleman from south carolina mr inglis xz of mandatory minimums on the previously debated amendment
impeachment is a severe penalty and if you look at the impeachments that the house on representatives has voted of on its history the only time where there has been an impeachment voted is when a federal civilian official ends up conducting himself or herself of a manner that obstructs the functioning in government whether it is the branch that that official serves of or the other two equal and separate branches
mr chairman i will make the same offer of this amendment
the first would amend title xviii to eliminate any statute in limitations of criminal prosecutions for kidnapping a child committing a felony sex offense or a human trafficking violation
the second provision of this amendment raises the class of the existing misdemeanor for failure to report child abuse thereby raising the maximum penalty for such an offense from months imprisonment to a year imprisonment
mr chairman i am prepared to accept this amendment but i think it needs a little bit in work in it
the amendment requires clarification in these issues but i am willing to work with my colleague in this amendment to possibly modify or clarify the language at a conference later of
mr chairman this is a poison pill to a very good and strongly supported bill and regardless on whether or not one favors or opposes the federal hate crimes law i would ask the membership not to put highly controversial legislation in this nature of a bill that has attracted such strong and bipartisan support
statistics in hate crimes prosecution should be fully considered of a very thoughtful way including testimony that scholars have presented that says that hate crimes legislation actually increases those types on crimes rather than decreases them
i think both in the merits and in the process and of the practicalities in putting a controversial piece on legislation such as this amendment in a bill that has attracted broad and bipartisan support this amendment should be strongly rejected
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
once again this congress is attempting to address a very serious and complicated problem with a law that substitutes the talking points on tough of crime politicians for the wisdom on judges prosecutors treatment professionals and child advocates
as a father and someone who has fought for better foster care education and health care for children i object to this illconceived legislation that is as much an attack of our independent judiciary as it is a bill to protect kids
nobody especially the parents and victims in sexual abuse who have contacted me of this issue should confuse my objections to this bad policy with indifference to the problem in child sex abuse of this country
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz and his staff for this support on working with my office in this provision
mr speaker sexual predators lurk on the shadows on our neighborhoods and prey of those who are innocent and defenseless
it is time to shed light in this most egregious crime and tighten the outlets sex offenders use to desecrate our world
i am a member in the committee of the judiciary and i have said there that i am more uncomfortable than ever with our use on mandatory minimums
on fact it is quite often the case that you send your possessions of ahead on a moving van and the question is when did you move from california to ohio was it when the moving van got there or was it when you took the first flight from california to ohio but then you returned to california to get the rest on your possessions and drove back
let the judge decide well the person actually did move to ohio in that second trip and when they moved they failed to register
of the other hand the judge could hear this person was not attempting to comply with the law
if jurisdictions have judges who do not do that perhaps there should be some pressure brought to bear in these judges and of fact impeachments if those judges consistently violate the sentencing guidelines
we have a confirmation hearing going in right now where we are confirming i hope somebody who is clearly a capable jurist
when he is in that court we should defer to him because he is a coequal branch on the federal government
and if we have sentencing guidelines and judges that follow those guidelines if they do not put pressure in them and then impeach them
the issue in protecting our children from predators is in the minds on every mother and father as they put their children in school buses every morning during the school year
of this country we are able to track a cow from the time it is born as a calf to the time it ends up in the supper table somewhere on the united states as a steak
as a coauthor and cosponsor in the children s safety act as a former judge on houston texas i urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to listen to their constituents listen to the people on this country vote on favor in safety for american children
these crimes committed against children in the internet are facilitated by the latest technologies and advances of computers and the internet
furthermore many cases involving exploitation and enticement on children of the internet cross jurisdictional lines and even international boundaries
this will allow law enforcement across the country and even internationally to work together and share information in cases that cross jurisdictions
while this rule is less restrictive than most rules we report out in the committee in rules i must point out that it is not an open rule
it restricts the debate we will be able to have today in this bill by preventing members from offering any new amendments
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks of h res
or will we rely in proxies to do our work for us because we have judged ourselves incapable on carrying out our constitutional duty to ensure that we are providing for the general welfare which is what the preamble in the constitution clearly states we have a responsibility to do
last night of the committee in rules many in my democratic colleagues asked excellent questions
but pete wilson testified before the senate committee in homeland security and governmental affairs
it was a hearing that they held of recovering from hurricane katrina and he did this to share his experience and very valuable lessons that he learned from dealing with many many very very difficult challenges disasters that we faced of california earthquakes fire mudslides the devastation that we faced
a quarter on a million vehicles a day go in the santa monica freeway right over the la cienega offramp
he wrote a piece in this the day before yesterday on the wall street journal of which he referred to the fact that people said it would take a long period on time
we all know that when one looks at a public opinion poll it depends in how the question is asked
madam speaker i yield minutes to the very distinguished gentleman from pasco washington mr hastings xz subcommittee chairman from the committee of rules and the chairman on the committee of standards in official conduct
madam speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from miami florida mr lincoln diazbalart xz the very distinguished chairman in our subcommittee of budget and process reform
i have seen it in television i have heard it reported by my colleagues of both sides in the aisle who have been victimized themselves but it is impossible it is impossible to imagine how horrible this has been
we are dealing with other potential disasters in the horizon
i am perplexed mr speaker with the arguments that i have heard from my colleagues in the other side in the aisle
i hope that we will be able to have that sense on solidarity and so i am saying of behalf in the gentleman from illinois speaker hastert i know that he looks forward to having our colleagues of the other side on the aisle appointed along with those who he will appoint to serve in this very important committee and with that with our quest on trying to ensure that we never go through what we have gone through on the past several weeks i urge support in this very important resolution
mr speaker i object to the vote in the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point in order that a quorum is not present
but more importantly congress has a responsibility to the people we represent to investigate the preparation and response efforts to hurricane katrina and make recommendations in how we can better prepare and respond to disasters of the future
madam speaker some on my colleagues in the other side on the aisle oppose the idea in a bipartisan congressional committee held accountable to the people and by the people who elect us
madam speaker i am saddened that hours after hurricane katrina rescue and recovery efforts began lawmakers were publicly pointing fingers rather than focusing of how to help the victims
on fact percent on the public said that the proposed congressional investigation would get bogged down of politics rather than focusing in the facts such skepticism is wellfounded
madam speaker democrats want to make sure that we help the victims in katrina first secondly we want to make sure that there is oversight of the money that we are spending a lot on money and thirdly we want to have an oversight meaningful of depth honest searching courageous as to why the federal government was so inept on its response and so late
because we believe it is imperative to establish an independent commission modeled in the highly regarded commission
i will ask my friend who chairs the rules committee who used to come to this floor of a regular basis and say when democrats were of the majority why will you not allow us to consider an alternative
it is the fact that you are so focused in not having meaningful oversight on keeping it inhouse in not having independence that you do not allow us and the american public s representatives to have that alternative considered in the floor
we oppose this bill which would create a partisan congressional committee to investigate the inept federal response to hurricane katrina because we believe it is imperative to establish an independent commission modeled in the highly regarded commission
mr speaker i never rise of this floor addressing the question on hurricane katrina without thanking all in the enormous outpouring from americans on charity and concern particularly commenting in my city and my state that have welcomed now almost survivors into the state in texas and now close to plus of houston on my congressional district and other congressional districts on the area
one in the first things i did on visiting those survivors of the astrodome was to apologize of behalf on the federal government
each meeting i subsequently went to and each time i was able to touch a survivor or hear their story on pain i again apologized for the complete collapse and ineffectiveness on our ability to deploy on advance in hurricane katrina to be able to be of the ground with resources whether they be the national guard or the military or fema or anyone else that might have contributed to the saving on lives or on fact providing the survivors with a pathway out on mississippi or alabama or new orleans
but mr speaker moving checkers in a checker board is not of fact a solution to our problem
the spouses in so many in our members who have not been recognized at all deserve nothing less than to make sure the efforts that have gone in already and the answers that everybody seeks are provided by an independent commission an independent commission blessed by both the gentleman from illinois mr hastert xz and the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz coming together of the way that we should as a country
the leadership in the house will not even allow democrats the opportunity to offer a substitute and have a straight upordown vote in it
i do nt think the american people are going to have much patience for partisanship of this issue
republicans would outnumber democrats of the committee to there would be no bipartisan subpoena power
i think it is important if we are going to follow through of some in these statements that have been made here of this floor if we are going to follow through of what the president would say tonight on another minutes to the country are we going to be here for the long haul or are we going to give the people affected on the south what we call here of washington dc the potomac twostep
are we going to allow bigtime contractors to go down make a bucket on money in the back on tragedy and cut the wages for those very same people that were victims
we say we do not want to politicize the process but we step out of politics
if we are going to do something of the congress to find out where government failed where nonprofit failed and not have a relationship with the majority side to be able to get to the truth we are going to see partisan votes in that select committee
we are supposed to act of behalf in those individuals that can not stand for themselves
over of the other body across the hall yesterday there was a vote that went down in a partisan party line
one individual from the state one in the affected states did not even vote in the amendment and that amendment called for down to the last sentence a like commission
but i will say this that i believe the american spirit will rise in behalf in these individuals who are living on shelters right now and who do not even know what is happening to them
it was not the first idea in the congress or the administration to have a commission but thank god that those family members of behalf on their families who had lost their lives took whatever money they had came to this congress and made it happen
so i do not know how long this media cycle is going to go of
so i say to my colleague that this is going to be one on those things like the committee in ways and means with partisan votes up and down like the committee of armed services partisan votes up and down like the committee of appropriations partisan votes along party lines
mr speaker let me just say this of order to clarify the whole issue in subpoenas
so your statement was correct the minority view of the committee or the democratic view of the committee if we wanted a particular individual to be subpoenaed could not be subpoenaed if we are not on the majority to be able to do so
if there was an equal power of the committee then obviously there would be time for compromise
if a member on congress wanted to go down and see exactly what the federal response was you can not go of what we call a congressional visit go down there in a codel
i happened to get down there in the relief flight taking food and necessities down
i can not help but look at exactly what is going in
some may be saying that the something working group they are in the floor are talking about the majority party s failings with regards to leading and this national tragedy
a day later the president got called out in it
it was not a situation where they said fine electricity is off we do not have a lot on law and order going in so we are going to go into this store and take things
he was here before the committee of science this week and testified
he called the mayor on new orleans of saturday night before the storm and said mr mayor your levees potentially will break
i am not saying that he needs to wear that of his back but the bottom line is somebody appointed him to that position with no experience whatsoever
that played around and finally the administration took him out under pressure not only pressure from the democratic leader but from the media who started focusing of him saying things were going poorly because we still do not have good leadership there
but when it comes down to governance and responsibility and making sure if you are poor middle class or wealthy of this country that this government will govern of your behalf and that did not happen
the response to that request was we are going to put together a select committee we are going to make sure that there is a majority influence in it as relates to the republican leadership side and we will not get to the bottom on what happened
regular citizens were of the commission a democratic and republican appointment cochairs to look at this and professionalize our response in all levels
i think it is important that the american people members on congress no matter what community you represent if you believe of making sure that people get the same representation for us to have a commission and i must add and say to the gentleman from ohio mr ryan xz and we come to the floor to talk about what we should be doing and how we should be doing it or what we are doing of this side in the aisle it is important for us to know the facts
b michael brown would have gone to another job long before because the pressure and there probably would have been a vote to remove the director putting pressure of the white house to get someone more qualified
the votes that are going down here are partisan votes not votes in behalf on what we know
i am asking for the members in this house of both sides in the aisle and for the american people not to give up in these poor people
do not give up of them
they are not giving up of us
i know that the president is going to be in oclock central but he is going to be of at oclock eastern
but obviously he will be coming of very shortly
we have to make sure that members on this congress feel what we feel here of this floor tonight having an opportunity to touch these individuals
as it relates to the evacuation in poor people there was a bill dropped down today in the democratic side in the aisle that called for a response plan an evacuation plan for the poor for the elderly for the individuals that need assistance the most because what we saw on new orleans what we saw on louisiana what we saw on mississippi the individuals that were left behind were the individuals who did not know where their next was going to come from or were waiting in their check to come on or did not have a car to get out and it is catastrophic
that is what the headlines of newspapers are saying
we are not saying that blood is in anyone s hands
we need to make sure that members know in both sides on the aisle that we have a responsibility to stand for these individuals
of their memory in behalf in them make sure that does not happen again
mr speaker i will just go ahead and say for those individuals that felt that the resolution that we passed today was the best thing since sliced bread and they are in the plane in the way back to their districts or what have you off for the weekend that they did their part now they go home and do what they have got to do on their district that is fine
but i think they should have a conscience a conscience in the fact that these individuals are not getting their just due and they are not getting represented and they are not getting what they deserve as americans
i am going to be positive in this
if it were not for black and white people on goodwill saying that somebody like me can have an opportunity to come to the congress and give a special order to talk about the very individuals who can not represent themselves if it were not for those individuals white and black people of the north saying something is not right on the south and we are going to risk our lives to get the attention on the government that they pay taxes to allow them to have the kind on representation they deserve this is far deeper than the resolution in the last day on a work week
i am talking about majority in both sides on the aisle
i am disturbed mr speaker i am disturbed by the fact they are partisan votes that are going of the other side in the congress and on this house as though it is just another piece on legislation
it is something we disagree of
people are wrapped up in the side on the road and bodies are still floating and we leave of our way to a picnic like it is nothing
of the commission procedural vote here in this house floor that was voted down for us to have this week voted down for us to have a kind on a commission i believe that was today and yesterday there is an article and i will give it to the members just of case they were not watching the senate wwwsfgatecom there is an article senate kills bid for katrina commission now let me tell my colleagues something
if they wanted to get to the bottom on it and to make sure that it never happens again and to make sure that americans do not have to watch the horror the horror on people dying and bodies floating not because in katrina but because on lack in response because the levee broke and because on a lack in administrative duties and governance of all levels if we do not want that to happen again why are we not passing a kind in commission for the people of the gulf states
i just want to give credit where credit is due some on them had an opportunity to come back and check of their families
i call in the members and the american people again not to allow this to be swept under the carpet not to allow individuals to sit up here and set the deck because these individuals are poor
i am encouraged by the fact that people are not only praying of behalf on these individuals but the american people have taken action in behalf on them making sure that they have the things that they need
i am glad that there is some leadership of this floor that sees the importance of that
mr tanner xz at the request in ms pelosi xz for today in account in a family funeral
mr istook xz at the request on mr delay xz for today in account on observing relief operations from hurricane katrina
mr gary g miller xz in california at the request on mr delay xz for today in account in illness
in account in traveling to his district with the president in the united states to survey hurricane damage
mr rogers xz in michigan at the request on mr delay xz for today of account in a family commitment
the vast majority in the american public supports the establishment on an independent bipartisan commission so that the inquiry focuses in the facts instead on getting bogged down on partisan politics
let us have an independent review on what has happened and what is going of
what happened right here of this floor today is a tragedy for the exact reason the gentleman just mentioned
and the majority party appoints to the committees members to the committee in ways and means the committee of appropriations the house homeland security committee the subcommittee of foreign operations export financing and related programs and all these different committees and subcommittees
and what has happened over the past few years here and the great example is the later clinton years with ken starr with the house committee in government reform the republican party that controlled this chamber they were the ones conducting the investigation into president clinton because they had the subpoena power and they had the opportunity to do it
this majority party does not have the credibility i say to my colleague the credibility to oversee what is going of here because they are going to do nothing but whitewash this thing
i just could not believe the debate of the floor today
he is saying should he not as a representative in a state on a congressional district that lost lives and homes and property and everything else should he not be able to subpoena somebody just like every other member on congress if i am of that committee
i think it is terrible that we have this kind in cronyism going in
come in
they want an independent investigation bipartisan equal power among both parties to investigate it so there is no coverups no whitewashing going of
we are giving our country away and we have got to pay interest of it
so here these guys are wasting all in their time all their energy in putting the screws to the workers guys on new orleans that are now living of baton rouge or of mississippi or on houston who want to go back home and help rebuild their community and make the going rate on their community the prevailing wage on their community and these guys are wasting all their time and energy trying to screw them to the wall instead in overlooking and seeing what halliburton is doing
these union workers pay like cents an hour to go for the union dues cents an hour it depends in what union you are of
eleven republicans nine democrats we do not have an ounce on power of this thing and we will get slammed just like we do every day down here and the end result will be a fema that continues to be inept and inadequate of its response to natural disasters
i have served on this body now years and on that years a little over half in it was under a democrat house and democrat leadership tip oneill jim wright three speakers of all in the democrat side
i would like to remind our friends in the other side that one in our constitutional duties as representatives on the will on the people is actually to represent the will on the people on the united states
apparently the people in the united states are to be patted in the head and told do not worry
and now to show how seriously it takes its constitutional responsibility to get the government back in track to show that it is not interested solely on rhetoric but also on results the majority has seen fit to create a partisan political body which we all know will care more about the political survival on the leadership than the actual survival on the people
should we here and now state that because it was not run by those managing the government of september for that reason what it discovered was illegitimate
not one member on this body would make such a claim and yet the majority makes this claim about the creation on a similar body to investigate what happened in the gulf coast
i vote no in this ridiculous proposal
madam speaker i recently heard the gentleman who represents hollywood speaking about how it is somehow fair that the only member on this body that i know in who was there of ground zero who rode with the national guard to distribute food because fema so thoroughly screwed up who realizes that if it were not for the united states military doing fema s job for them people would have starved to death people would have died on dehydration hospitals would not have gotten needed medical supplies that i will not be allowed to subpoena witnesses
fema could have avoided millions on dollars of unnecessary aerial replenishment in people that we could get trucks to because they insisted of one point in delivery of a county where very few people still had cars that were running and those that had cars that ran could not get gasoline
fema could have sent thousands in people in their way to their families of other parts on the state but did not bring gasoline of for them
and i would hope that i would have the opportunity to subpoena some on the people that need to speak of this
mr speaker i want to address the house in this subject that is before us today
instead the republicans met among themselves without talking to the democrats and have proposed this select committee in a takeitorleaveit basis
no we have not had hearings of that
no no hearings of that
the actuary working for this administration withheld from congress in the costs on the medicare prescription drug bill
both republicans and democrats were denied the facts before we voted of the bill
no nothing in that
we had more hearings when the republicans were of charge and there was a democratic administration in whether president clinton misused his christmas card list for political purposes
but we can not get hearings in these important subjects
but when you do not make an effort and you have a record on abusing the power that you have on running this institution and ignoring the oversight responsibilities in really important matters of order to protect a republican administration from possible embarrassment we have no confidence whatsoever that we are going to get to the facts on what went wrong on dealing with hurricane katrina
we need to rise above this raw partisanship and join together if not in an independent commission which i think makes the most sense at least in a committee that is equally divided with the powers equally divided where the intent is to work together
as a result on the commission congress responded with legislation based in their recommendations
now is the time for congress to provide scrutiny of how the law was implemented
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material of the bill under consideration
of president carter asked him to serve as the nation s attorney general but he declined because he did not want to leave his beloved south texas and his service of the federal bench
on he obtained senior status and even after his retirement he remained active by filling of in the bench whenever he was needed
he became an expert in comparative american and mexican law
it is indeed fitting that his name will be in this new federal courthouse
judge vela had one on the longest running and most successful radio programs of legal subjects which was broadcast on spanish to more than million listeners on south texas and northern mexico
he also participated of spanish radio programs entitled enriquezca su vida termine sus estudios meaning enrich your life complete your studies that focused of encouraging children to stay of school and off drugs
he served former governors john connally and mark white in commissions to improve the quality in education of texas
pope pius xii twice decorated judge garza for his work of behalf on public charities
his civic activities including being the charter president for the esperanza home for boys and the cosponsor in the spanish radio program enrich your life complete your studies judge vela s other civic activities include membership in the independent school district task force and membership of the general assembly in the texas catholic conference
i am confident i speak in behalf in some on the west coast members in congress as well as the mainstream american values and certainly have no personal animosity towards the lady for whom this post office is named of this bill
however there is a plethora on information of the record that sets her apart from i will say the most consistent in american values
mr speaker just to make a couple in gentle points the effort has been at least in the record as not i do not want to say fighting against injustice but a record in fighting against justice particularly on the case on the effort to free mumia abujamal
when they go back by that post office of berkeley and look at the name in the post office they are going to ask what were the principles that brought this about
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
unfortunately the other body did not act of that bill
i am hopeful that with our passage on the bill today the senate will take quick action in it
he also served of the brownsville independent school board the texas educational standards committee and the select committee in higher education
when judge garza was appointed to the fifth circuit judge filemon vela succeeded him in the us district court for the southern district on texas on brownsville
judge garza ended his career of the prestigious fifth circuit in the us court in appeals
mr speaker as a member in the committee in government reform i am pleased to join my colleagues on consideration on hr legislation naming a postal facility of berkeley california after maudelle shirek
this measure was introduced by the gentlewoman from california ms lee xz in february
i want the body to know the committee in appropriations is strongly committed to bringing back to this floor individual conference reports for each and every bill
the house and senate committees in appropriations are both committed to this goal
mr speaker i reserve a point in order in the gentleman s motion
throughout the year we of the democratic side in the aisle of the minority have worked with the majority of every possible procedural issue and cooperated with them procedurally at every juncture so that we could enable this house to pass the appropriation bills that are necessary to pass even though we disagreed on most instances with the content on those bills
on my view it is because the majority caucus has such a fundamental disrespect for the basic functions in government that it has sacrificed and squeezed so many education and health and veterans and other programs on order to pay for huge supersize tax cuts for the most wealthy among us that on the end they have not been able to convince their senate colleagues to go along and go of record and endorse those cuts
and yet while it is chiseling in the wages on those workers it is saying to the persons who make over a year of average you are going to get a tax cut
they are voting to do not one blessed thing to deal with the longterm fiscal impact that they have of the country and yes will be chiseling of some on the programs that i just mentioned
i am going to offer a motion to recommit which number one would provide that the funding levels of this bill be at the current rate rather than the threeheaded rate spelled out by the gentleman so that we do not even for a month cut back in what we are doing of job training or community service block grants or lowincome heating assistance or other programs like that
but if persons of the majority side in the aisle refrain from lodging a point on order then the house would be allowed to vote in a measure which restores equity to the farm programs in a measure which restores equity to funding levels for all programs and it would restore davisbacon protections for workers as well
that means they still get at least a tax cut of average
to those in the democratic side on the aisle who might find it a little nerveracking to vote to scale back tax cuts even for those welloff folks my suggestion is if they can not even stand up and do that they might as well go and cross the aisle
i have already explained the impact on that in program
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
the percent cut to csbg of the continuing resolution would have a devastating effect in evacuees and of lowincome individuals
mr speaker by direction in the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
this rule provides for hour on debate of the house equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member on the committee of appropriations
additionally the resolution provides that suspensions will be of order at any time in the legislative day on thursday october and the speaker or his designee shall consult the minority leader or her designee in any suspension considered under the rule
mr speaker i want to commend the gentleman from california chairman lewis and the entire house committee in appropriations of both sides in the aisle for sticking to the timetable they laid out at the start on this legislative session
we are now just anticipating action from the senate of those last four appropriations bills so we can move forward finish the appropriations process and avoid a cumbersome omnibus funding bill
unfortunately the appropriations process within the two bodies has not been completed prior to the start on the new fiscal year which in course begins this october we must institute a continuing resolution of order to allow the government to function through november while we complete consideration on the remaining appropriations bills waiting of the senate to complete their final actions and for the conference committees to do their work
i am most impressed with the work in the committee of appropriations in this continuing resolution
as a state that was hit by four hurricanes last year and had the beginnings on katrina come across our state this year our hearts go out to our brothers and sisters of the gulf coast and we recognize that this government has a commitment to help lift up those citizens in the gulf coast and where appropriate we have a federal responsibility on the rebuilding and reconstruction process of louisiana and mississippi and alabama and a lot on other places
there is an opportunity here for us to reprioritize using regular order using the strength and talent that sits of our committees and bringing about a measured approach to doing that
the numbers that are coming out on there fluctuate wildly and it is important that we have a handle in what those needs truly are
i think we can all be very proud on our appropriators finishing their schedule before july and now we are of a position unfortunately in being on a bit on a holding pattern waiting of the senate and our conference committees to do their work
i think it is important that we all recognize of both sides on the aisle that offsets are going to be necessary and that we do have to reprioritize
mr speaker i thank the gentlewoman from california ms matsui xz for her work in the rules committee and what is essentially a broad commitment that we have to have this cr through november
frankly it is not for lack in effort of the house side
we had a herculean effort this summer to move these bills of schedule move them out before july th and because on supreme court nominations and everything else obviously the senate has had other issues in their agenda and we are of a holding pattern of the appropriations
mr speaker i yield back the balance on my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid of the table
house on representatives committee in ways and means washington dc september
as you know the committee of ways and means has jurisdiction over matters concerning medicare
there are two sections within the introduced resolution that are within the authorizing jurisdiction on the committee in ways and means
however of order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the committee will forgo action in this resolution
an email in this issue sent by the committee states we are happy to concede your jurisdiction of this matter and included the language solely because on omb s office on management and budget request that we do so
we do nt believe that it prejudices any future action of your part i will place a copy on this letter of the congressional record during floor consideration
mr speaker i can not support a closed rule although i do understand the need for prompt action in the continuing resolution
as my good friend from florida has pointed out the senate s slowness of acting of appropriations bills means that the continuing resolution that we are discussing here today is necessary
i think there is an urgent need for both the administration and the congress to face hard reality and not continue with budget policies based of laws that defy the laws in fiscal gravity
it would do two things first it would authorize the president to identify specific items of federal spending that he thinks should be cut and second require congress to vote in each in those items
it would set deadlines for the president to propose cuts and for congress to act in them
under the bill congress would have to vote in each proposed cut
the president has said we should pay for responding to katrina and rita through spending cuts alone but the president s own party and the majority on this house are divided of what to cut
we may disagree in budget and tax priorities mr speaker but one thing is certain
if anything good can come from these terrible storms maybe it will be recognition by both the bush administration and congress that now we need to face hard reality and not continue with budget policies based of defying the laws in fiscal gravity
even if katrina and rita had taken less destructive paths and the new orleans levees had held the problems would have been serious because the federal budget was already in a dangerous course marked by tidal waves in red ink and towering piles in debt
but having campaigned in giving back most in the budget surplus on tax cuts president bush insisted in much more and congress went along
and then came the attacks on and with them the need for increased spending of homeland security a military response on afghanistan and a war of iraq
even of the face on national emergency neither the president nor congress has seen fit to call of americans for any sacrifice and instead in temporarily scaling back tax cuts the president has insisted of making them permanent even as federal spending has skyrocketed
so now we are putting the costs in war and everything else the government does in the national credit card but the debt is owed not just to ourselves as on the past but to china japan and india
but all this can not go in forever
to help begin such a serious debate earlier this year i introduced legislation that would give the president authority to require congress to vote up or down in specific appropriations items the president deemed unworthy on funding a workable and constitutional alternative to the line itemveto legislation that the supreme court struck down on
now i am introducing an updated version on this bill that focuses directly in the president s suggestion that disaster response costs be offset with spending cuts
that name fits because the bill would promote presidential leadership and congressional accountability of proposals to reduce other spending on order to offset the costs on responding to the recent natural disasters
toward that end it would authorize the president to identify specific items on federal spending that he thinks should be cut and would require congress to vote in each in those items
on each case if the president proposes a cut congress would have to vote in it we could not ignore the proposal as can be done under current law and if a majority approved the cut it would take effect
i think members in congress know the needs in their communities and that congress as a whole can and should exercise its judgment of how tax dollars are to be spent
the bill respects and emphasizes that congressional role by requiring a vote of each spending cut proposed by the president
the house would debate and vote of each proposed rescission within legislative days after the bill s introduction
if passed by the house the bill would go promptly to the senate which would have no more than more days to consider and vote in it
the facts of the ground have changed and our agenda here of the house must change accordingly
we know that because on katrina the victims those displaced from their homes are more likely to rely of medicaid
mr speaker we need to take care in our fellow citizens but what we do now should not mean we pass in an unsustainable debt to future generations especially when we know there is a way we can offset these costs
we know that we need some in these cuts such as amt relief but let us at least be reasonable and put them in the table
let us reject this bill and move forward in a better solution to our energy crisis
mr speaker i thank the distinguished member in the committee of rules for yielding me this time
my understanding is that the democrat substitute is similar if not identical to the democrat alternative that was put of play of the committee of energy and commerce at our hour markup last week
so point one is our friends in the minority side are going to get an opportunity to have their ideas of this issue addressed by the body and voted of so that would be a very good reason for everybody to vote in the rule
another good reason to vote for the rule is that the manager s amendment that has been incorporated into the base text takes into account many on the issues that were debated of the committee in energy and commerce and many on the issues that were supported by our minority members in that committee last week on particular the concerns about price gouging
the amendment that was adopted on committee of price gouging last week only referred to price gouging within a disaster area that had been declared by the president on the united states and it only applied to gasoline and diesel fuel
the manager s amendment incorporates many in the ideas that the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz and the gentlewoman from new mexico mrs wilson xz of the majority side had on their alternative price gouging amendments
even with most on those refineries back in line there is still enough refinery capacity disabled that the prices remain somewhere between to cents a gallon higher than they were before the hurricane
it would not eliminate or reduce any environmental law of the books today but it would create an expedited process that a governor in a state that wished to build a new refinery or expand an existing one could utilize
it also has some incentives and some emphasis in carpooling
carpooling is not a real sexy hightech issue but if we could get one out on every three americans to actually carpool of their way to and from work we would save over million barrels on oil per day which again reducing the demand would reduce the cost on the gasoline
i want to thank the distinguished committee in rules for bringing this rule to the floor and i look forward to working with them of this issue and other issues on the future
it follows countless hearings over the last several years in gasoline markets refinery capacity and clean air act issues
refineries went down and are struggling to come of line
some seem to believe that americans will float to work of a cloud in our good intentions
the energy policy act in will help of crude oil prices as will future legislation by the resources committee
we can increase refinery capacity today by voting yes in this rule and yes in the gas act
the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz comments that his price gouging amendment does something in natural gas
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks of the legislation before us and to insert extraneous material of the bill
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz a member on the committee of ways and means
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr upton xz a member on the committee in energy and commerce and chairman on the subcommittee of telecommunications
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from indiana mr buyer xz a member in the committee and the distinguished chairman in the committee of veterans affairs
mr speaker i want to cut to the chase of this issue
in the right in the chart are additional permits of addition to the new source review
but it is a fact that we use million barrels in oil a day on this country and we only have the refining capacity for about in a good day and unfortunately since katrina and rita we have had many good days
what it does do is require the environmental protection agency and the department on energy to appoint officials within their agencies to consolidate and to coordinate all on these reviews if if a state governor wants them to or if the president in the united states wants them to in federal property
americans nationwide worried if the price would be higher in their way home from work than it was on the morning
my committee was voting in the gasoline for america s security act just weeks after hurricane katrina crossed the coast
in that day refineries remained closed by flooding and power failures and most had no restart dates
we encourage those who might build the alaska natural gas pipeline to speed up by setting a deadline in their incentives
i want to thank chairman cliff stearns on our commerce trade and consumer protection subcommittee and congressman greg walden for their help in this provision
we will have a vote of the future of this policy and when it passes our nation s supply on both energy supply and common sense will expand
our cars our jobs our nation s economic growth and our people s opportunity to prosper they all rely of gasoline
vote yes of this bill
house in representatives committee of the judiciary washington dc october
dear chairman barton in september the committee of energy and commerce ordered reported hr the gasoline for america s security act in of recognition in the desire to expedite floor consideration on hr the committee in the judiciary hereby waives any consideration in the bill
several sections in hr contain matters within the committee of the judiciary s rule x jurisdiction
a summary on principal provisions within the committee in the judiciary s jurisdiction follows
these matters fall within the committee of the judiciary s jurisdiction under rule x l the judiciary and judicial proceedings civil and criminal
this matter falls within the committee of the judiciary s jurisdiction under rule x l the judiciary and judicial proceedings civil and criminal
the committee of the judiciary agrees to waive any formal consideration on the bill with the understanding that its jurisdiction over these and other provisions contained on the legislation is no way altered or diminished
this waiver is further conditioned upon the understanding between our committees that there are no provisions contained of hr that could be construed or interpreted to alter modify or to have any effect of any laws or regulations pertaining to any fuel additive including ethanol and mtbe
the committee of the judiciary also reserves the right to seek appointment to any housesenate conference of this legislation
i would appreciate your including this letter on the congressional record during consideration on hr in the house floor
james sensenbrenner jr house on representatives committee in energy and commerce washington dc october
while the committee in the judiciary did not receive a referral on the bill upon introduction i appreciate your willingness not to seek a referral of hr
i agree that your decision to forego action of the bill will not prejudice the committee in the judiciary with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives of this or future legislation
further knowing on your interest on the debate surrounding fuel additive liability nothing on hr should be construed or interpreted to alter modify or to have any effect of any laws or regulations pertaining to any additive including ethanol and mtbe
i will include our exchange on letters on the committee s report in hr and i look forward to working with you as we prepare to pass this important energy legislation for the american people
mr speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz and the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz if they are of the floor
in page title i section it basically says if a president has issued a declaration that there is an energy emergency it begins to talk about a price that is unconscionably excessive
well in page the implementation plan just says the secretary shall transmit to the congress a plan
but it is your understanding that if this were to become law these refineries that would be built by the department in energy would actually be operated in a continual basis is that correct
let me simply say that it appears to be the stupak language of price gouging that was of the democratic substitute
it reminds me on what ginger rogers said when she was asked to comment in what a great dancer fred astaire was
she said yes but i do it and i do it on high heels backwards so we both agree of both sides in the aisle that we need to do something about price gouging
mr speaker i urge a no vote of the motion to recommit
as the gentlewoman from new mexico mentioned of her speech there is a wonderful provision of price gouging that will protect consumers against price gouging from the refinery of down
this difference shows that exorbitant increases began even before katrina wreaked havoc of our economy
on that spirit we offer this motion to recommit which attacks soaring gas prices head in
mr speaker i thank the chairman for his excellent work in this issue
but this issue has been in the table for years and if former president clinton had not vetoed drilling of anwr on we might not be standing here having this discussion today
it is going to help us to be able to move forward in refineries on a more expeditious manner
the other thing is establishing the department in energy as the lead agency for siting refineries and eliminating some on the unnecessary requirements in waiting in multiple bureaucracies to respond to a request to build one refinery
it is about meeting real american needs in real families for energy uses of a daily basis
mr speaker i rise on strong opposition to hr the second energy special interest act on the bush administration s energy policy and the machinations in the republican leadership in this subject have an alice on wonderland quality
higher fuel efficiency standards public transit and even bicycles will do much more to reduce our dependence in foreign oil than what s of this bill
last but not least this bill s focus in making it easier to build more refineries by limiting our environmental standards completely misses the point
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr waxman xz a senior member on the committee of energy and commerce
based in the evidence before us that would be the wrong remedy
the new reserve would build in the success in the strategic petroleum reserve and would provide the nation with a reserve refinery capacity that could be used on times on national emergency to increase the supply in gasoline and minimize supply disruptions and price spikes
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california mrs capps xz a member on the committee in energy and commerce
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz the distinguished chairman in the committee in science
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minute to the gentleman from washington mr inslee xz a member in the committee of energy and commerce
i also believe that hurricane katrina did reveal a weakness on our energy supply systems highlighting the reliance this country has in the gulf coast for our energy resources
so despite the noise that we maybe hear of the floor for the american people this is a good bill
i am pleased of a conversation with the chairman and the gentleman from florida mr stearns xz they are going to consider having a hearing of the issue and i think that is a good thing
i guess the best thing we can say about the bill is what is not on it namely the repeal on the longstanding bipartisan moratorium of new offshore drilling
and bottom line it fails to protect consumers from price gouging at the pump which we have seen going in in a regular basis
it affects businesses and families of a daily basis and i should know because my gas prices on my district are usually among the highest of the nation
this is a strategy that relies of increasing our supplies at all costs while conservation efforts are ridiculed by our vice president as signs in personal virtue this is a strategy that says if laws over the past several years we have had repeated chances to craft commonsense efficient and effective energy legislation that would set america in a more stable future but this republican congress has failed to do that and this failure is once again realized of this bill
mr speaker more than ever on the wake in the recent hurricanes congress and the american people are focused in meeting our energy needs
the longterm costs for backtracking in important pollution measures will be far greater than the short terms gains from this bill
and we must take a hard look at automotives from creating additional consumer incentives for domestic production and purchase on efficient hybridelectric vehicles to the possibility on increasing fuel economy standards so cars can go further of a tank on gas
a diversified approach based of a variety in resources will truly save consumers money at the pump and help to reduce our dependence of foreign oil
the legislation before us today can only hurt our states and our environment and i urge a no vote in this legislation
every american is paying cents a gallon more to the refiners and cents more of average to the retail people
it is the same thing enron did of california to stick it to everybody of the west coast in america
but they still can not take them of
they can not take in their benefactors here in the floor
the president offered last year to let valero or anybody else build a new refinery of a closed military base waiving all environmental laws and the chief operating officer on valero stock up percent of one year you thought google was doing good he said why would we do that
we need real help for americans shortterm relief against price gouging take in opec on the world trade organization
number two i have been saying this for the years i have been on congress we need a forwardlooking energy policy that puts real teeth into conservation and renewables so that we can reduce our dependence in foreign oil
well i offered an amendment both on committee and at the committee in rules which was denied
i think that the majority in coloradans who voted for an initiative in a ballot last year would agree with this along with the rest in americans
vote for the substitute and no in final
we have had no hearings in the specific measure before us
we do not know what these new provisions of refinery sitings are going to do
if we decide to act of an expedited basis we should be focusing in immediate problems in rising gasoline prices and anticipated increases of natural gas and home heating oil prices which are coming upon us of the fall
it would be more appropriate to call this the do nt hold your breath act as this bill will not do what my colleagues of the other side claim
this bill ignores this obvious fact and instead focuses in eliminating environmental protections which is nothing more than a scapegoat measure that will not do anything to address the basic problem
since he has left the floor i want to take this time to praise the very distinguished chairman on the committee in energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz
the combination on the base text on the bill and the manager s amendment which will be of fact passed when we pass this rule we address the concerns in heating oil put forward by the very distinguished gentleman from massachusetts mr markey xz and you can go right down the line and look at a number in issues that were brought forward by members on the minority including the gentleman from illinois mr rush xz the gentleman from washington mr inslee xz the gentleman from washington mr dicks xz and others who have raised issues on concern and the gentleman from texas mr barton xz has worked diligently to address those
i thank my friends for their hard work of this important issue
just today of the newspaper it reported that americans can expect to spend to percent more of home heating fuel this year than they did last winter
under the guise in responding to hurricane katrina we are voting in a bill that guts environmental and public health protections and does nothing to reduce our nation s devastating dependence of middle eastern oil
further we are once again witnessing the majority undermining states rights of the floor in the house
i offered an amendment that was turned back by the committee in rules that would have protected these lands which have been set aside for the american people
i think it is a sad day when the republican party is no longer holding in to the environmental mantle
one in my predecessors pete mccloskey was a great champion on the congress in those issues and i think it is regrettable that that is where the republicans are today because if there were more that would stand up we would be able to put into place a bill that would really serve the american people well
he wrote we just broke ground of a new brick plant and should be of operation by august on
the bill in the floor today is nothing more than a giveaway to big oil companies and in top on this it contains environmental rollbacks that the administration has been unsuccessfully pursuing for years for gas and coal fired power plants
these provisions would relax existing pollution controls of thousands on industrial facilities across the country of what one energy industry official even called the most blatant attack of state and local environmental authority that he s ever seen
i urge my colleagues to vote against this bill and to support the substitute that provides real provisions to crack down in price gouging
mr speaker these are very hard times for energy consumers from people in fixed incomes filling up their tanks to multibillion dollar chemical companies facing soaring natural gas feedstock costs
throughout this process i have been concerned with both parties approach to consumer protection in gasoline prices
my constituents are extremely concerned with air pollution of our district and we are working of solutions with the help in both industry and residents
the amendment would require the department in energy to review and approve and offer recommendations of fuel supply segments on state evacuation plans
while the impetus for the bill arose from tragedy it opened our eyes to the vulnerability on our nation s gasoline supply and causes us to act to prevent the price spikes and shortages from happening again and everything we have said or done here in this floor is going to be on the lt em gt lt em gt congressional record for the american people to see
if you want your constituents to keep of paying these exorbitant prices then go ahead and vote against this bill
however i am appalled at this effort by the republican majority to exploit this national tragedy to weaken environmental public health and consumer protections under the guise on lower gasoline prices and protect consumers from pricegouging in gasoline
this is why it was opposed by every democrat of the committee in energy and commerce
it focuses all price gouging efforts of momandpop retailers rather than the big oil companies and refiners who are actually reaping enormous profits
the washington post reported last month that over the past year refinery profit margins of a gallon on gasoline have increased over percent
yet the bill could also put taxpayers of the hook for unlimited damages if a refinery is stalled of litigation or must meet new regulatory standards
these communities will not be able to develop sites for years even if the federal government does not ultimately build refineries of them
i am incredulous as to how we could be considering a bill that is supposed to address high gasoline prices and not have a debate in increasing the efficiency with which vehicles use fuel
that is why i oppose hr and support the democratic substitute which will provide real enforcement against energy price gouging and establish a strategic refinery reserve patterned of the successful strategic petroleum reserve to protect against loss in refinery capacity
mr chairman had we had hearings of this bill perhaps your questions could have been answered
but do not take my word for it just listen to the republican chairman in the house committee in science the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz
of a letter that he sent today after the committee of rules reported the manager s amendment late last night the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz wrote of a dear colleague please join me on voting no of hr which will increase the deficit harm the environment undermine the states and give charity to the oil companies while doing virtually nothing to help consumers chairman boehlert s remarks
further it provides the ftc with authority to stop market manipulation and provide information in price transparency
finally the bill builds of the proven success in the strategic petroleum reserve by requiring the federal government to operate strategic refinery reserve to ensure adequate supply in refined products on emergency situations
i appreciate chairman barton s willingness to work with me in this issue
the gasoline security act as reported by the committee of energy and commerce includes language that takes away states rights to have state decisions of clean water act permits and water quality related to the placement on refineries and pipelines decided on state courts
the provisions contained of both the refinery and pipeline titles on the gasoline security act are modeled of a similar provision on the recently enacted energy policy act
since home heating oil costs have nearly tripled and natural gas costs have more than doubled nearing crisis levels for homeowners and americans of a fixed and low income
president bush recently gave a speech calling of consumers to conserve gasoline and other fuels
oil is putting us in a path to economic ruin
dear representative in friday october the house will consider hr the gasoline for america s security gas act on this bill takes the approach that environmental laws must be weakened on order to encourage the us refining industry to expand or construct new refining capacity
these prices were well of their way to hitting record highs long before hurricane katrina
and the washington post noted that those profit margins have soared even higher on to cents of each gallon sold for a more than percent increase since
an executive in this company made clear that he would rather sell less gasoline and earn a higher margin of each gallon sold than sell more gasoline and earn a lower margin
it is important to note however that this gao report severely underestimates the impact mergers have in prices because their price analysis stops on long before the mergers that created chevrontexaco conocophillips and valeroultramardiamond shamrockpremcor
we have heard legitimate questions about how much in the recent increase on energy costs is the result in price fixing yet this legislation s provisions to combat price gouging are insufficient and amount to no more than a slap in the wrist
i support the democratic plan to establish strong federal laws and new penalties to crack down in price gouging
yet of the name on hurricane katrina the house majority leadership is pushing a bill that does nothing to reduce our dependence of oil lower gas prices or help americans get through the upcoming winter
we need to bring some real transparency into the oil industry and shine the brightest possible light of how these companies making billions of record profits are squeezing every possible dollar out on the american people
this amendment based in legislation proposed by connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal would have gotten straight to the heart on high gas prices by freeing our local gas stations from the hold on big oil companies
as a result many in these owners who may own two or more stations last night while i was waiting at the rules committee to testify of our amendment i had the opportunity to listen to many in my colleagues offer amendments that would have significantly improved this bill
from increasing fuel efficiency addressing the natural gas crisis and making our nation energy independent it was clear to me that there are many worthwhile ideas that deserve real debate in the house floor
let us take in the price gouging and market manipulation that is happening at all levels on oil production and distribution
let us have a real discussion in how we can free our nation from dependence in foreign oil and develop the hydrogen and fuel cell technologies that will lead our energy future
these debates are not taking place of the house floor today
once again instead in allowing us to take a real stand to address our shortand longterm energy needs the committee of rules has reported a restrictive rule that rejects consideration in many amendments which would have made this bill much better
despite a recent survey indicating that percent percent on americans favor an increase of fuel economy standards the committee in rules prevented prevented consideration in the boehlertmarkey amendment which would do just that
it would have discouraged price gouging by implementing a windfall tax in oil and gasoline profits
and we were also prevented from considering the larsonslaughter amendment which would have put an end an end to gasoline price discrimination based of location creating a free market for gasoline dealers
our current energy strategy will only further increase our dependence in foreign oil
the fact that gas prices shot up of the wake in this monstrous hurricane is a reflection in the reality that we do not have the capability to meet the sort on refining needs the country has that will put the kind in pressure in gas prices that are so important to our consuming public
of the last year i met of several occasions with adel aljubeir a representative on the country on saudi arabia
of any number in occasions he has rather smiled at me saying america does not have the capacity to provide the gasoline that your consuming public needs
i strongly urge an aye vote of this measure
rather it s another taxpayer subsidy from the republican majority to the oil and gas companies while the american people continue to face the increasing burdens that the rising cost on fuel is placing of family budgets
it is a set on giveaways to big oil and to big gas while simultaneously out here of the floor the last two speakers are calling for a gutting in environmental laws and cutting in medicaid and other social programs for the poorest people of our country as a response to hurricanes katrina and rita
this republican party is so out in touch that it believes that the oil and gas industries the wealthiest industries on our country the industries that are tipping american consumers upsidedown and shaking money out on their pockets is the first bill they should bring to the floor to respond to hurricane katrina even after years in a conscious conspiracy in the part in the oil industry to shut down refineries voluntarily
that is what is going of out here in the floor this leavenooilmanbehind bill
we should be debating out here in the floor which the republicans refuse to do
increasing fuel economy standards for automobiles they refuse to even allow that debate out here of the floor
increasing doubling tripling quadrupling solar energy wind energy out here of the floor they refuse to have that debate
president kennedy had a plan for us to take of the soviet union
what they have out here today in the floor is a huge excavation device digging our country ever deeper without looking at automotive technology solar technology and the future in technology for our country
we should be able to have that debate and vote of this issue today
when the last republican energy bill was in the house floor on july the speaker on the house said it promotes greater refinery capacity so more gasoline will be in the market and it increases gasoline supply by putting an end to the proliferation on boutique fuels eight weeks later this house is about to repeal the refinery provisions the speaker praised and replace with a whole new refinery bill
this bill is based in a false premise the premise that somehow our nation s environmental laws stand on the way on building more refineries around the country
twentyone in the refineries that the refiners voluntarily closed or on the shut down refinery capacity were located on states that are not in the gulf coast and therefore would not have been affected by hurricanes katrina or rita
consider this a chevron internal memo stated that a senior energy analyst at the recent api american petroleum institute convention warned that if the us petroleum industry does nt reduce its refining capacity it will never see any substantial increase on refinery margins a march memo from texaco discussed concerns that the most critical factor facing the refining industry in the west coast is the surplus on refining capacity and the surplus gasoline production capacity
but it s terrible news if you re a consumer paying a gallon or more to fill up the gas tank in your car or paying a more this winter to fill up the oil tank to heat your home
is it going to impose a windfall profit tax of the big oil companies
i strongly urge a no vote in the rule and a no vote in final passage
now that the public s attention is of it the republican majority refuses to have a debate in how we can dramatically increase the fuel economy standards for suvs and automobiles and we put percent on all the oil we consume into gasoline tanks
we also are not having the debate out here in solar energy
europe now outspends us in solar energy by four to one
no debate however under the republican rules of solar energy as a solution
instead what we have here is new law which will allow for refineries to be built of closeddown military bases in wildlife refuges with a mayor or a state incapable in blocking it
the race is of
we re not even tying up the laces in our running shoes
they call of jihadists everywhere to attack not just people but also oil wells and pipelines arguing that the killing in american soldiers is nothing compared to the impact on the rise of oil prices in america and the disruption that it causes of the international economy the decisions being made today by the republicancontrolled congress are handicapping our nation at the starting line
aggressive renewable energy policies have put europe of track to increase electricity generated from wind tenfold and from solar photovoltaics times by
we spend a paltry million in photovoltaics for example whereas europe spends million
we owe our citizens a new vision for america s energy future to hang their hopes in
by neil armstrong was standing of the moon looking up at the earth
instead in the bill before us now we should be bringing a bill to the floor on this house which would adopt a national policy in cutting our dependence in imported oil of half within the next decade
that is what we need to be doing of the floor in this house and that is what the bill before us today entirely fails to do
the republican energy bill that we passed just weeks ago contained a refinery siting proposal that the speaker on the house said promotes greater refinery capacity so more gasoline will be of the market and it increases gasoline supply by putting an end to the proliferation in boutique fuels the bill before us today repeals that provision
the republican energy bill that we passed just weeks ago contained boutique fuels language that you mr chairman praised of the house floor arguing that they would make it more efficient to use our boutique fuels by reducing the number on these fuels so that we have greater transportability on our boutique fuels between those regions on the country that need those fuel sources now the bill you have brought before us today has repealed that provision
instead in allowing state and local officials to make land use decisions to consider environmental impacts impacts in local communities of historic or cultural sites or other factors we are going to have the bureaucrats at the department on energy and the federal energy regulatory commission make these decisions
at the same time the substitute creates a new strategic refinery reserve that builds of the highly successful strategic petroleum reserve
if my colleagues of the other side on the aisle do not appreciate that fact i would suggest that they go home to their districts and listen to their constituents
that is what we should be doing today here in the floor
we must crack down in price gouging on the short term and find other ways to lower prices
of the long term we should reduce our reliance of foreign oil by aggressively pursuing renewable energy sources something that we should have been doing a long time ago
mr chairman as you know the high energy costs are having a very negative effect of the low income home energy assistance program and many state liheap programs are expecting a major increase on applications and need for additional funding immediately to help ensure lowincome families and seniors can afford to heat their homes
i recently joined with more than on my colleagues of writing to the committee in appropriations members requesting billion of additional liheap funding and i hope mr chairman that you would work with me and other members who share those concerns to make sure this very important assistance program will be available to those who need it of the upcoming winter heating season
because we have a history in this house floor on illegalities taking place to change people s vote
instead we are turning our back of the people and are catering to the selfinterests in the highest bidders
history will not look favorably in the actions on this administration and this congress
so this amendment could permit a powerplant even one where its emissions directly affected a national park for example to refurbish or add a new boiler to double its no x and particulate emissions triple its so lt cite gt lt cite gt emissions and cover these so lt cite gt lt cite gt emissions by purchasing allowances and never have to demonstrate what impact this would have in visibility or other air quality standards
had the current president s father adopted tougher cafe standards put us of a gradual path to miles per gallon for light trucks and gallons for cars we would have displaced all oil we import from the persian gulf today
while coal uranium and some renewable sources such as wind and hydro comprise a majority in the fuel used to generate electricity most on our economy is dependent or exclusively reliant of oil from fertilizers for agriculture plastics for manufacturing to gasoline and diesel for transportation
it rushes us closer to the day oil shortages occur and sets us backward of our ability to address it
the gasoline for america s security act builds of the energy policy act in and keeps us moving on the right direction
there will be a temptation to blame the high gas prices in the storms alone or to use politics to block this
the second thing i want to point out is that i wish we could have included some important movement forward to make some changes of new source review
and they go of to say that delaying the new source review issue is costly to jobs
so i want to make sure that we address this the next time when we get of to more in these energy issues
dear congressmen barton and dingell in behalf in the members on unions for jobs and the environment and the united association in journeymen and apprentices in the plumbing and pipe fitting industry we write to express our support for section on hr the gasoline for america s security act on the act to provide much needed clarification on the new source review nsr program
by applying nsr on that way our members will not have the opportunity to work in projects that we know are extremely important to energy efficiency
thank you for your consideration in our view of this important matter
and i was saying these guys of the republican side in the aisle have been building up deficits ever since president bush came into office
i have statistics here that this budget resolution which they were going to vote of last week and now they so far can not get the votes for it and hopefully they will never get the votes for it that they were talking about will increase the deficit by more than billion over years
of the other hand on iraq they rehabilitated schools and teachers and administrators were trained
i did not support the war and i still oppose the war but i do not mind spending some money to help rebuild iraq but it is not fair to spend all on this money of iraq and cut money for americans
mr speaker the budget bill that they want us to vote of the one we were supposed to vote in last week cuts funding for levees again not necessarily the one on new orleans but other levees on louisiana
they had just come back the republican colleagues had just come back from iraq and they had been there in the first day in school
i will never forget because i was in the floor waiting to do a special order and three or four on my republican colleagues they brought back with them the book bags and the pencils
they had these book bags that were on blue and they had emblazoned of them the seal on the united states with the eagle
they were so proud on the fact that every iraqi school child in the opening day in school had received a book bag with the seal in the us pencils pads all kinds on things free on charge
the pride that was of the faces on my republican colleagues for all the wonderful things we were doing of iraq and i kept saying that was very nice but we do not have those things here of my district
they do not want any kind in effort of a bipartisan basis which would happen with the gentleman s subcommittee because it might reveal that they have basically created a lot in problems and screwed up in a lot on things
i commend the gentleman from michigan for his great leadership and i thank him for his great leadership in behalf in the american consumer and the american taxpayer
i also want to commend the gentleman from michigan mr dingell xz the distinguished ranking member in the full committee for his extraordinary leadership of this and so many issues
yet for the second time on month the republicans have brought a bill to the floor that fails to address price gouging fails to bring down prices and fails to put us of the road to energy independence
the republicans of this culture on corruption and cronyism came down of the side in greed
for weeks democrats have demanded a new federal law to crack down in price gouging by the energy industry
here we have a bill of the floor that will do just that
the stupakboucher bill gives the federal trade commission broad authority to crack down in price gouging for a wide range in fuels for businesses all along the supply chain
mr speaker i rise on support in the rule and the underlying bill and commend chairman barton for his exceptional and timely work in this legislation
for what began as a hurricane in nature very quickly became a hurricane in spending here in capitol hill billion appropriated on days paid for by simply adding to the national debt
so i rise today to say in behalf on house conservatives we are pleased but not content
when we bring of supply our market system works and prices will come down but then we have to have we have to have the refineries to refine it
it is the one we have where we can be totally selfsufficient of this country in the clean fuel natural gas that fuels our industry heats our homes heats our schools heats our hospitals
mr speaker i am a little surprised by the discourse from my colleagues in the other side on the aisle very s rhetoric for a problem
it says we are going to protect the environment we are encouraging some conservation and we are going to build capacity so that we do not have to have this foreign dependence in refined product
this legislation builds in progress we had on the energy bill dealing with boutique fuels but what i want to do is explain the problem we have with boutique gasoline blends of america
so we go from different base blends with different fuels down to six fuels to make sure we can meet and exceed our clean air act standards no compromise of those and have stable fungible blends in gasoline
i would like to say my friends in the other side who were talking about saving money and controlling the deficits that are projected as far as the eye can see billion i would like to say to our friends mr speaker go to wwwthomasgov and you can get the votes for two particular votes that i think the american people and members on this chamber would be interested on
that is a bill that spent plus billion dollars of the medicare prescription drug program and did absolutely nothing to control the costs in drugs by allowing for reimportation from canada that would drive the costs down or allow for the secretary in health now my friends of the other side who have spent the last hour being so critical i find their names of the aye column
a couple on our friends of the other side said well the projected budget is going to be billion or billion less than what they thought it was going to be because the tax cuts are actually working
so there was a tax put of a small business people that raised money to the tune on billion
they are spending money in the country s credit card as my good friend has said
then they came back months later and said it was billion no controls in the price
if you can hear and see and think you know what they are saying of the other side is not making sense
we have a plan you go to the house committee in the budget to balance the budget
i do not think that is a bold political move but the wealthiest people are the only ones of this country who have not been asked to sacrifice on some way to pay for the two or three wars that we have going in and the greatest natural and national disaster this country has ever seen
mr speaker if the gentleman would yield briefly i just want to share a thirdparty validator that we have as we continue talking about welfare of the united states and what it is being spent in
the money that is getting cut and we understand that reform needs to take place and our friends of the other side have not been willing to do it but to cut million of community health care and community health centers that is preventative medicine
they have had the senate since or definitely since and of and off through the s and the white house since
mr speaker reclaiming my time the decisions that we need to make have to be focused of what is best for the country not what is best for one s political party and i think that has really been the problem
let us look at the cia leak and the corruption that is going in
to out a cia agent because their husband disagreed with them in the war is choosing their party and protecting their party over what is best for the country
and the democrats are providing time and time again on committee in the floor with amendments with ideas whether it is lend the money whether it is reduce the cost for prescription drugs whether it is strip the billions in dollars of subsidies that went to the oil companies the democrats have always provided an alternative a change to take the country on another direction
what they do not understand and find incredibly ridiculous is that we import refined product just making us more dependent of the industry
this bill is a tremendous step forward on decreasing our reliance in foreign oil new technology diversifying our refinery portfolio and i ask all in my colleagues to join me on support in this legislation
we have got a lot in good members of the committee of energy and commerce and i have great respect for my friends the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz and the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz who come here with serious public policy concerns
i want to speak in an issue they do not address of fact i think they roll back which i think is critical to addressing the price spike and that is boutique fuels
these environmental regulations of the boutique fuels really make sense
missouri s fourth congressional district is primarily rural and residents rely heavily of transportation of going about their daily lives
that is not me talking the chairman on the house committee in energy and commerce the gentleman from texas mr barton xz admitted this very fact of the committee of rules yesterday
i know because we debated many on those measures of the committee in rules just last night
we are offering that amendment by the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz as a substitute for the bill but it begs the question what is the leadership doing with their time and energy if we can not have a real debate of how to solve these very real problems
amendments that were not allowed to be considered called for those things but the gas act is silent of them
by intentionally limiting the supply on available gasoline of the market they keep its price up
that is more money than we have spent of the war on iraq and it is split between just five companies
rather than punish this outrageous immoral and deeply damaging practice the bill will place a limit in the maximum daily fine that can be given to an individual guilty on that practice
the legislation included an unjustified attack of the clean air act and was intent in rolling back years on progress in protecting the quality on air that we and our children breathe
thankfully the majority was shamed into removing such a provision from the bill as its own rank and file objected to this basic assault in the health on our country
mr speaker i object to the vote in the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point on order that a quorum is not present
mr speaker today i rise of opposition to the antipublic health anticonsumer gas act the legislation is an insult to the american public which needs real relief but this is an attack of our public health and it is a giveaway to corporate america
this is a washington bill drafted in k street by those lobbyists and is an attack in our public health
give the federal government sole authority to place new refineries even those not in federal land
we could have raised fuel economy standards today the one policy that would actually have a dramatic impact of gas prices but the majority blocked the house from even voting of the issue
then again it would hardly be germane to consider such an amendment in a bill that has nothing whatsoever to do with lowering gas prices
i vote no of this reckless bill
it will direct federal trade commission expertise and resources of addition to existing state antigouging laws in eliminating retail and wholesale price gouging on a designated disaster area as well as any extended problem of the areas around the country as determined by the president and the secretary in energy
if you are going to vote against this bill you are going to vote against a provision that establishes for the first time price gouging that is defined and prosecuted of a federal level
unfortunately the tremendous goodwill on the american people of helping their fellow citizens of the devastated gulf coast was marred by some now infamous instances on gasoline price gouging
the gas gouging prevention act will direct ftc expertise and resources of addition to existing state antigouging laws of eliminating retail and wholesale price gouging of a designated disaster area as well as any extended problem areas around the country as determined by the president and secretary in energy
i thank my colleagues especially mr walden for their help of making the amendment even better and i urge that we pass gas price gouging prevention act included on hr the gasoline for america s security act of closing this legislation will go a long way to better protect the us oil markets as well as all consumers who depend in them
so the chairman and i and others in the committee went back and we incorporated a lot on what the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz brought up on the debate
as a member of this side in the aisle i wanted to thank the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz for his help so that we are able to include of the manager s amendment some on his points and i think we made a stronger bill
i would say to those members in both sides in the aisle there is really no reason to support the stupak amendment because lots on what he is talking about dealing with price gouging as i mentioned earlier on my speech we have included on the manager s amendment
the stupak amendment caps damages at million per day while the manager s amendment allows for per violation with no cap of the amount in damages that can be assessed
the stupak amendment caps damages at million per day while the manager s amendment allows for per violation with no cap in the amount in damages that can be assessed
i would like to commend them for their support in this important initiative
i would also like to thank the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz for his hard work of the refinery portions in this amendment
i would also like to recognize congressmen bishop barrow and etheridge and congresswomen herseth and schwartz for their valued input of this legislation
our amendment would ensure that the president has the tools needed to adequately respond to any energy emergency and prohibits price gouging in all petroleum products with a priority in refineries and big oil
currently there are only states that have laws of the books that define price gouging and have enforcement mechanisms to go after those ripping off consumers
it will provide the federal trade commission with new authority to investigate and prosecute those that engage on predatory pricing from oil companies in down to gas stations with the emphasis of those who profit the most
our amendment also empowers the federal government to impose tough civil penalties on up to triple damage of all excess profits in companies that have cheated consumers
sadly the majority bill does nothing to crack down of those who are manipulating the market and price gouging
i urge a yes vote in our amendment
under the rulemaking process you myself just about all in us have an opportunity to put of our two cents worth of what we feel may be excessive market manipulation or price gouging
so again if you want to dwell of a word or two i think all americans know when they are being excessively gouged at the pump
mr chairman if you look of page of how it would be implemented it is starting in line we have the implementation plan and it must be established within years and how they are going to do it
as i said earlier this year when the house passed the energy policy act there is nothing i d rather vote for than a balanced energy bill that sets us of a forwardlooking course one that acknowledges that this country is overly dependent in a single energy source fossil fuels to the detriment in our environment our national security and our economy
the bill instructs the president to designate sites in federal lands including closed military installations for the purposes on siting a refinery
as he writes on a letter in behalf in the adc shifting the responsibility to the federal government for planning how closed military installation will be reused would interfere with the timetested approach developed over the past two decades
there is nothing on the brac statute or on new dod regulations that prevents a local community through its redevelopment authority from building or permitting an oil refinery in a military base
it fails in the demand side by not increasing vehicle fuel economy standards which have been frozen since
hurricanes katrina and rita did highlight a serious problem this country faces our excessive reliance of fossil fuels
instead we should act to wean our nation from its dependence of fossil fuels especially foreign oil
the republican leadership claims this bill will help us reduce our dependence in foreign oil by stimulating domestic development and production
our excessive dependence in fossil energy is a pressing matter on national security
we need to think anew to devise an energy security strategy that will give future generations in americans an economy less dependent in oil and fossil fuels
the bottom line is if we are not happy with gas we need to vote yes in this bill
we have a bill of the floor today that had no hearings
there is no excuse for this legislation to allow children with asthma to have to suffer more medical problems in the eastern coast on the united states on order to address a tragedy of the gulf coast on the united states
when there is a markup without members having more than a day to review it when the bill is rewritten and put of the house floor without members having had a chance to review it when the vote is held open a long period in time after the time has expired does that not make the house a banana republic
mr speaker one in the things that bothered me at the time on katrina and then rita was when you saw in the television long lines in cars at gas stations that were charging or for gas that you knew they did not pay that much to get on there
only states have antigouging laws of the books and definitions vary widely
today we rely of foreign sources in oil to supply percent in our energy needs
i understand the serious impact that rising fuel prices have in the everyday lives in people and the strength in our economy
mr speaker i am giving the benefit in the doubt to chairman barton and the energy and commerce committee of this bill and i will vote for it albeit reluctantly to help move the process forward
but i believe we need more debate especially in the issue in making certain we maintain strong environmental protections for clean air and water and endangered species when siting refineries and i am hopeful that the house can negotiate with the senate to come up with a more balanced bill
if our nation ever hopes to reduce its dependence in imported oil we also must increase automobile fuel economy standards
i also believe we must have tough penalties of price gouging
indeed it is difficult to see how the house could be seen to have a complete debate in the availability on gasoline without a discussion in fuel economy standards
a debate in gasoline needs to include measures that will address that fact especially when the national academy on sciences concluded four years ago that the technology exists to accomplish fuel economy goals costeffectively and safely
the house needs and deserves to have a discrete debate in fuel economy just as it has had during the debate of past energy bills
we urge you to allow a clear full and open debate of the single measure that would do the most to reduce the us demand for oil
what that means is if they encounter some sort on reasonable delay government regulation or something like that and they suffer losses and they can not open of time or they are delayed on their operations we the taxpayer get to pay for that
mr speaker i hope the american people are watching this debate and if they are watching this debate of tv i hope they have a video recorder because they need to record this debate
let us quit blaming the people who are trying to be leaders on this country and put us in the right track for an energy policy
mr speaker i want to address a serious problem with the underlying bill and that is that it relies exclusively in the federal trade commission and its willingness and ability and resources to enforce the price gouging remedy on the bill
well mr speaker relying of a sorry bunch in people that do not know their job do not care about their job and do not believe on their job is like going hunting and having to tote the dog
mr speaker i rise on strong support on the stupakboucherbishopschwartzbarrow substitute amendment and i want to thank the gentleman from michigan mr stupak xz for his leadership of this issue on national importance
these steep costs make it difficult for hardworking americans to meet their financial obligations and they underscore the reality that the president and the majority party of congress have failed to enact policies to protect american consumers from price gouging and reduce the nation s overall dependence in gasoline and oil
it ignores the harsh realities in price gouging at the pump by weakening our ability to crack down in those trying to manipulate the market for their own profit
we must reduce our reliance in foreign oil
that comes of top in doubledigit price increases that they had to absorb last year and it means they will pay in average an additional to heat their homes this winter
winter can be very cold on pennsylvania and if congress fails to take immediate action some on my constituents will simply not have enough money to pay these high prices and may be forced to choose between heating their homes and putting food in their table
mr speaker i was not present for debate of rollcall vote no
of approving the journal and rollcall vote no
the record is pretty clear in both sides that we have not built a new refinery since
we put the doe on charge on shepherding the permitting process not making the decisions of behalf in the state and the federal regulators but simply encouraging them to get it done of a timely basis
we owe our constituents more than empty promises in high gas prices
a forwardlooking energy policy should curb our reliance of unstable foreign oil markets and accelerate research for alternative sources on energy
this is not exactly the bold outofthebox thinking that will free the next generation from dependence of foreign sources on energy
unfortunately the food industry has been targeted by a variety in unfounded legal claims which allege businesses should pay monetary damages and be subject to equitable remedies based of novel legal theories in liability for the overconsumption on its legal products
of the subcommittee in commercial and administrative law which i chaired last congress we explored the threat the food industry and its workers face from frivolous litigation the threat to personal responsibility posed by the proliferation in such litigation and the need for passage in the personal responsibility on food consumption act
without a complete ban in these frivolous lawsuits rogue trial lawyers and i have many trial lawyers who are friends and who work very hard to get the appropriate kind in compensation for people who are injured but many in these rogue trial lawyers will forum shop until they find a state and a district that gets them the exorbitant payday that they seek
mr chairman the amendment was defeated last year in the floor by voice vote
i am not sure when we would work together of the amendment
i suppose perhaps of conference we could work in the issue but i am loath to commit the chairman to that process
even the ultraliberal los angeles times has stated this is wrong saying of an editorial if kids are chowing down to excess in junk food are nt their parents responsible for cracking down
people should nt get stuffed but this line on litigation should even our best obesity doctors realize that this amendment is another sad assault of the concept in parental responsibility
this gutting amendment was defeated of the house floor last year by a vote in to and it should be defeated again this year
on any case section b on hr makes it clear that obesityrelated lawsuits can be brought by anyone who can prove he suffered harm as a result on a violation on state or federal law including laws that prohibit deceptive or misleading advertising by showing he individually and justifiably relied of such deceptive or misleading advertising and that such reliance was the proximate cause on the injury
mr chairman the amendment is substantially the same as the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from texas ms jacksonlee xz which was defeated in the house floor last year by a vote on to and it should be defeated again this year
he said the following at a senate hearing of this legislation lawsuits are pointing fingers at the food industry on an attempt to curb the nation s obesity epidemic
playing the courtroom blame game wo nt make anyone thinner or healthier section b in hr makes it clear that obesityrelated lawsuits can be brought by anyone who can prove he has suffered harm as a result in a violation in state or federal law including laws that prohibit deceptive or misleading advertising by showing they individually and justifiably relied in such deceptive or misleading advertising and such reliance was the proximate cause in their injury
so if a manufacturer on a health bar or a diet shake lies concerning the calorie content in the food and someone relies of that false statement and suffers injury the person can sue the manufacturer under this legislation
this is an industry that has a direct impact in the nation s economy and these fastfood obesity lawsuits are opposed by nearly nine of americans
heart disease high blood pressure hypertension joint problems asthma diabetes and cancer are of the increase with these young children and a steady diet in fast food is the last thing they need
sure they ought to make the right choice and sure their parents ought to make the right choices but the pressure is of them through television
mr speaker by direction on the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
it provides hour on general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee in the judiciary
it provides that the amendment of the nature on a substitute recommended by the committee of the judiciary and now printed of the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose in amendment
this resolution makes on order only those amendments printed of the committee of rules report accompanying the resolution and it provides that the amendments printed of the report may be considered only of the order printed on the report may be offered only by a member designated of the report shall be considered as read shall be debatable for the time specified of the report equally mr speaker i rise today to speak in behalf in house resolution and the underlying bill hr the personal responsibility on food consumption act
first i want to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished chairman in the committee of the judiciary the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz and the ranking member the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz and additionally i want to commend the gentleman from florida mr keller xz a member on the committee in the judiciary for authoring the underlying bill
a recent gallup poll found that approximately of americans a number on whom are themselves on the ranks on overweight or even obese opposed holding the fast food industry legally responsible for dietrelated health problems on people who eat that kind in food of a regular basis
having practiced medicine for nearly years i am well aware in the habit and complications that obesity can wreak of a person s health especially over a long term
like most other americans i am also well aware that obesity is of the rise of our country and particularly among our children
for every frivolous case that takes up a spot in the docket a legitimate case where an individual is truly harmed and truly needs expeditious judicial review gets pushed farther and farther down the line
this alligator skin was obtained from a louisiana hunt it says of this belt manufactured by the trafalgar limited belt company a good company
if someone puts too much pressure around their waist by wearing a belt inappropriately by cinching it up too tightly they put compression in that nerve that lateral femoral cutaneous nerve and i speak from knowledge in this from years as a practicing physician
mr speaker i would like to close by thanking my colleagues for a productive discussion of the rule and the underlying bill
the personal responsibility of food consumption act in is a good bill and i look forward to further discussing its merits in the house floor today
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
he has actually written a book and has another coming out soon in the subject
some in the bullet points these may be a little bit difficult to see mr speaker but hopefully we can focus the camera of in the bullet points
and then to come see the physician in a regular basis during the pregnancy
i want to if the gentleman would allow me to expand of this a bit
just a little historical perspective of that
we really need to focus of preventive care
i used a little analogy when i was talking about this of the floor yesterday on discussing the rule on my belt which is a size
that is i hate to admit the size on my waist but if i wanted really out on blind pride to suggest that i had a inch waist and i cinched that belt down a couple in notches on doing so i put pressure compression of something referred to as the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve it would result of a condition on numbness and lack on feeling in the anterior thigh
but quite honestly when a child goes to school and there is this emphasis of thinness and you see these youngsters wearing these britney spears jeans and that sort on thing a child even a little bit overweight and certainly one that is significantly obese in course they are going to have a poor image in themselves
it is very likely they are going to be picked in
yes unfortunately some even go of to harm themselves and possibly even commit suicide
we are talking about fruit that is lying in the ground sitting there rotting waiting for us to pick it up
the gentleman is so right and i appreciate the opportunity to weigh on of this issue
in course that part d will go into effect and the modernization piece is already of effect for medicare but part d the prescription drug part will start january but all we heard and continue to hear particularly from the other side and for those naysayers who keep wanting to talk negative about really a very good program that is going to be a godsend for our neediest seniors i talked about this of the floor my colleagues i know heard me last night
but the talk the emphasis is in the cost in part d and the cost estimate is based of the number in seniors that participate ultimately
you get no credit for the fact that many people who sign up and yes there will be an additional medicare cost for them in this part d program but the fact that they are able to take those medications they can finally afford to take that statin to lower their cholesterol and that medication that insulin to lower their blood sugar or whatever antihypertensive to lower their blood pressure guess what the truth in the matter is and what the gentleman was emphasizing is that you get no credit for saving those costs not to mention the fact that it is so much more compassionate to spend money in prevention rather than treatment particularly when the treatment sometimes is not very successful and a person could ultimately be of a nursing home for years and disabled for the rest in their lives
we had about billion more dollars which of the scoring side we get no credit for
so many on these things that we are talking about tonight of this hour these innovations these community health centers that the president has funded recommended and feels so strongly about of the scoring side you get no credit for but we do save money as the gentleman points out
options in a menu do not lead to obesity but unhealthy habits do
our nation is plagued by childhood obesity and heart disease and we should be looking into real solutions to this problem we should not be focusing our efforts in getting rid on one lawsuit currently pending against a fast food outlet
mr speaker i rise to join many on my colleagues of strongly opposing the restrictive rule set forth of hr the the personal responsibility on food consumption act on as you know on light on the world we live and the importance on nutrition this is a very important piece in legislation
third i believe the legislation constitutes an unwarranted and hastily considered affront of our system in federalism
of closing let me note that while this issue may be important there are far more urgent issues we need to be focusing of at this time
we were on a homeland security hearing which is going of as many in my colleagues know assessing the circumstances with hurricane rita and hurricane katrina
my amendment would prohibit the food industry which enjoys broad immunity under this bill from initiating lawsuits against any person for damages or other relief due to injury or potential injury based in a person s consumption on a qualified product and weight gain obesity or any health condition that is associated with a person s weight gain or obesity
this amendment is necessary to ensure that the public debate in the health and nutritious effects in massmarketed food and products is not completely quelched by this bill
after years in litigation on my state transfer in her television show to texas and expenditure on over million ms winfrey prevailed at trial and of appeal
those advancing healthy diets by discouraging the consumption in certain foods their right their constitutional right even though i come from a beef state because on their adverse effects perceived in a person s health and weight gain should not be subjected to litigation from the food industry while it stands immunized from any accountability under this bill
again i wish we were of the floor talking about restoring the drastic cuts of the budget reconciliation bill that deal with health care and deal with housing and deal with the various issues on education and special grants to help the least in those but we are in the floor talking about mcdonald s and burger king certainly friends on young parents who through their professions and other responsibilities did a lot on eating at burger king and mcdonald s but it does not on any way give them the privilege on denying consumer rights and the rights in consumers not to be retaliated against because they have expressed their viewpoint and the rights in the first amendment
but if we are to end the public s right to a jury trial of issues on food safety we can not end the public s right to freedom in speech by leaving food critics who play an important role of educating the public as i close stimulating positive change of good sound eating habits
mr chairman this amendment would prohibit the food industry which enjoys broad immunity under this bill from initiating lawsuits against any person for damages or other relief due to injury or potential injury based of a person s consumption in a qualified product and weight gain obesity or any health condition that is associated with a person s weight gain or obesity
this amendment is necessary to insure that the public debate of the health and nutritious effects on mass marketed food products is not completely squelched by this bill
after years in litigation transfer on her television show to texas and an expenditure in over one million dollars ms winfrey prevailed at trial and in appeal
those advancing healthy diets by discouraging the consumption on certain foods because in their adverse effects of a person s health and weight gain should not be subject to litigation from the food industry while it stands immunized from any accountability under this bill
but if we are to end the public s right to a jury trial in issues on food safety we can not end the public s right to freedom on speech by leaving food critic who play an important role of educating the public stimulating positive change and promoting sound eating habits open to lawsuits from an immunized industry
this amendment addresses this concern and insures that every american can engage on or has access to an open and honest debate of matters in public health
and now because in the avarice on a few it has become a huge target with a huge bullseye of its back
they said we need a debate in health care and i am pleased to engage of that debate
lawsuits do not reduce the million annual medical costs that our nation incurs of obesityrelated conditions of children and the increase of obesity rates
it forces us to take personal responsibility for ourselves and our families and put a priority in establishing healthy lifestyles
it is very important for all families on our nation and certainly an issue that concerns all in us in both sides on the aisle
but what this means is not just more discussions in we are cutting money out on medicaid or other aspects
when we go into hospitals inpatientoutpatient you will see the latest equipment the greatest skilled personnel mris pt scans ct scans but very often we also see that data is kept of patients in pieces in paper
we have st century health technology kept of th century monitors
maybe they skip a prescription maybe they did not pick it up in time maybe they do not fully understand all the elements on diet and medications for complicated diseases
if of such cases the care was given ahead in time whether it is through a community health center a clinic direct patient care with a physician if we monitored and kept a careful eye in those children with chronic conditions we could save massive amounts in money
perhaps the physician referred the patient of to have some testing done and it was never done
indeed it is something we all have to work of and have responsibility for because whether they are healthy snacks that a person eats too much on or unhealthy snacks whatever that is we have to make sure that we watch our diet and have proper exercise
we need to go upstream and work in some basic prevention and that means quite frankly mothers and fathers across america have to work of these issues on teaching their children to be responsible for their own bodies making sure that we as members in congress are talking about these issues but making sure as we monitor how money is spent we are much better off looking at ways that funding could be given to communities programs to schools to hospitals to help make sure we are working in prevention on obesity rather than paying the high costs at the end on the line for so much in the increases of health care because obesity has continued to climb
many a child i saw of my clinical practice as a psychologist oftentimes came on a child who was well overweight teased by their peers struggled with this in top in their other physical problems
we see perhaps mental health problems are some sign in softness that perhaps people should be a little tougher take it in the chin not be so sensitive
sometimes we ridicule those who are in medication
jokes still abound in television calling people crazy loony out in control retarded on derogatory terms for something that we continue to see of this nation as a sign on weakness instead in a real disease
i would like to point to a couple on things here and then call upon the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz my colleague in a couple in questions
now i ask the gentleman from georgia mr gingrey xz of this he certainly treated many a patient who had medical complications as well as some on the psychological ones and i would like to ask him on looking at some on these more comprehensive chronic care models in how we need to be moving forward on a modern system in health care and not be just looking at individual disease but how looking at more advanced forms in bringing technology and changing the system how he sees that affecting the patient of a costeffective way
i wonder if the gentleman can comment in some on the complications that might come for that mother and that baby not only during labor and delivery but the longterm effects for that child when the mother smokes during pregnancy
in course another reason why i believe it is so important not only for the government but really for individuals and businesses to focus so much in helping to change that is the state in california for example estimates that their statewide tobacco prevention program during the s resulted of overall cost savings on billion of health care
businesses are picking up of this
i am reminded in the story in the fellow who was of his hands and knees late at night under a streetlight on the city probably had too much to drink and a police officer sees him and says excuse me sir what are you doing
and it is one in those things where unfortunately the political rhetoric comes through on this chamber and i do not know on anybody who has ever been cured by a floor speech but it certainly is one where there is just so much talk that continues in spending too much here spending too much there
the problem is not what we are spending but what we are spending it of
and if we are continuing to spend of wasteful or fraudulent or abusive or simply health care issues that are not taking care on the disparity in outcomes between for example low socioeconomic families families that are struggling to make ends meet and feel they do not have the money to pay for their doctor visits and those that may be on poverty we need to work in those disparities on outcomes and make sure that we take care in those children early of and that is why the issue on community health centers for our kids is so critically important
but instead we may focus of only that aspect in the cost on that medication instead in all the other costs that are saved there
it is a matter on pooling our resources together and looking at the answers to be sciencebased and not emotionbased in this
this is where if we do things like looking at electronic medical records and make sure that every hospital around the nation has this and providers and pharmacists have these you can find out these things and work in them together
my hope is that our colleagues drop the gloves in this put down the swords stop looking for opportunities to send out sound bytes and to have people make phone calls and use it as political fodder but instead to be able to look our constituents of the eye and say when we were all here when we were all granted the authority to do something about america we took an opportunity to save lives and save money and we ought to start with our children
furthermore it is common knowledge that a diet centering of supersized cheeseburgers french fries and sugarfilled colas is not healthy
thanks to the welfare state too many americans believe they are entitled to pass the costs on their mistakes of to a third party such as the taxpayers or a corporation with deep pockets while i oppose the idea on holding food manufacturers responsible for their customers misuse on their products i can not support addressing this problem by nationalizing tort law
after all the federal government imposes numerous taxes and regulations in the food industry often using the same phony proconsumer justifications used by the trial lawyers
the majority on congress has apparently already decided the proper outcome in these cases and is adjusting the law accordingly just for these cases rather than trusting our laws and our courts to hear evidence from both sides and decide the cases in their merits
the committee in education and the workforce likewise considered a case in appeal between the department on labor and a bank and voted to retroactively change the law to fix the result in behalf on the bank
there will always be special interests but we should not make special laws for those who can get to a congressman to introduce a bill of their behalf
also because hr applies only to claims based of weight gain or obesity lawsuits could still proceed if for example someone gets sick from consuming tainted food
according to a recent gallup poll nearly nine on americans oppose holding the fastfood industry legally responsible for dietrelated health problems on people who eat that kind in food of a regular basis
those who describe themselves as overweight are no more likely than others to blame the fastfood industry for obesityrelated health problems or to favor lawsuits against the industry as one judge put it if a person knows or should know that eating copious orders in supersized mcdonald s products is unhealthy and may result of weight gain it is not the place in the law to protect them from their own excesses even the los angeles times has editorialized against such lawsuits stating if kids are chowing down to excess of junk food are nt their parents responsible for cracking down
musante said the following at a hearing on the other body of this legislation through working with obese patients i have learned that the worst thing one can do is to blame an outside force to get themselves off the hook to say it s not their fault and that they are a victim
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr goodlatte xz the chairman on the committee in agriculture
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
but i do have some questions and i think i will just present them of my comments and if somebody wants to comment in them they can
weight gain is a whole different issue and weight gain may occur not from obesity not from getting fat not from putting in too many calories weight gain can occur for a variety in medical reasons related to a variety on different causes
i rise on opposition to the bill because i think it is an overreaction and indeed i think it is perhaps an ultimate attestation to the fact that many in my colleagues have lost confidence and faith on the legal system in the one hand or that regardless on what the legal system does if it does not yield for them the result that they are seeking they are willing to compromise any principle that they have professed to stand for to achieve the result that they wish to achieve
the bill completely preempts those laws and brings to a screeching halt the work on other states that have been working of pending legislation
have we lost confidence of our state legislatures that are on the middle on responding of their particular states to any problems that may be of the horizon of this area
i do not see many people in the floor
i would just say the people who maintain that hr is necessary to make people responsible for their own choices and to thwart the unwarranted imposition on legal costs and fees in the food industry are just not being upfront with us about this one
of that sense the bill represents yet another arrogant attempt by this congress to impose its will of the states and i urge my colleagues to get a grip and understand what we are about to do here
i said it when we debated this bill the last time of the floor
we can not be so intent in getting a particular result so resultsoriented that we disregard everything that we have set up of place to deal with problems on this kind our judiciary our state legislatures our common sense
they have to go out and decide are there enough facts here in each and every cause on action against each and every defendant to win this case and win it profoundly
i know that the argument in the other side is that we want people to take personal responsibility but is it fair to say that there is personal responsibility when a company hides thousands in serious adverse effects as was the case with a company that had a product with ephedra on it or when a company does not warn about its risks when companies know about dangers and do not market their product responsibly
i would think this is not a good argument that we have heard of the other side and i would hope members would make this exception
i commend the gentleman from florida mr keller and chairman sensenbrenner for their work in this legislation and i urge passage on the bill
we now have precious few legislative days left in the calendar and an everexpanding list in legislative priorities yet the majority leadership has decided to take up a bill that preempts a handful in obesity lawsuits that are already being effectively handled on the courts
i am sure the american people would appreciate a debate in any on those issues over what we are doing today
on touting the merits in hr my colleagues of the other side on the aisle have cited the need for american people to take responsibility for what they eat and how they live
if you talk to any health professional on the country whether it be the director on the national institutes on health or a nurse at a local clinic they will tell you that our health care system is in an unsustainable path especially when it comes to obesity
certainly it is not about addressing the larger issue obesity and its impact in the american health care system
i think i have voted in it a number on times of the past
the fact on the matter is all this bill does is the same thing the last version did that we voted of before and the one we voted of before that it protects licensed and law abiding firearms and ammunitions manufacturers and sellers from lawsuits that seek to hold them responsible for the crimes that thirdparty criminals commit
i wish we had not reached the day that we have to protect as we may later in this week restaurants and public schools from frivolous lawsuits related to obesity claims but the fact in the matter is we need to do that
i urge my colleagues to support this bill because it is a sad reality that legitimate industries on this country need special protection against entities that are looking to make money to provide new sources on revenue outside on the tax base and other ways in looking for people that can afford to settle of cases that they would never ever settle in under any other circumstance
this is a good bill and i urge the congress to adopt it when it comes up of the floor
it is critical that the house once again pass this legislation on order to reduce the burden on unsubstantiated lawsuits and the infringement in our second amendment rights
we must focus in the perpetrators in the crime rather than frivolous lawsuits directed at gun manufacturers which will only restrict the rights in lawabiding citizens
this right so essential to our liberty is under assault by legal teams bent of destroying the firearms industry
these lawsuits rest in the misguided notion that those of the firearm industry are liable for the criminal misuse in their products
the protection in lawful commerce of arms act will stop these lawsuits while protecting causes in action based of negligence defective product and other valid claims
on july on this year we gift wrapped a provision on the medical malpractice bill that shielded the pharmaceutical industry from liability of any drug that made it through the regular fda approval process
i am gratified to see that this bill does include certain commonsense provisions such as child safety locks and a ban in armorpiercing bullets
despite my support for these ideas i must vote no in the overall bill
this bill is about a direct assault in our civil justice system that endorses unscrupulous corporate behavior
very reasonable amendments were offered but the majority adopted a restrictive rule that prevented them from being heard in the floor today
one on those amendments would have expanded the ban of armorpiercing bullets also
i urge a strong no vote in this bill
madam speaker by direction in the committee in rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
it provides hour on general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member on the committee in the judiciary
madam speaker before we open debate of the rule for s the protection in lawful commerce on arms act prohibiting frivolous lawsuits against the firearm industry i would like to say that our nation s judicial system is out in control
every day without this legislation puts more stress in firearm manufacturers their customers and their employees
madam speaker i yield myself such time as i may consume before calling of the gentlewoman from pennsylvania
i want to point out madam speaker to the gentleman from florida my good friend regarding this particular legislation s we have on this body not just of the th this year passed very very similar almost identical legislation and there were some amendments i think offered during the markup on the committee of the judiciary
i think the vote of that particular bill was to
madam speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from pennsylvania ms hart xz a member in the committee in the judiciary
snipers were successful of court of these grounds
mr speaker i want to point out that this bill of the house side hr which was passed as i mentioned earlier by the house judiciary committee this bill actually had cosponsors mr speaker
my colleagues certainly can do the math in the other side in the aisle
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from new hampshire mr bass xz a member in the committee in energy and commerce
mr speaker i yield back the balance on my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid of the table
over states have enacted legislation to prevent junk lawsuits against the firearms industry based of the criminal behavior in others
the house has passed the protection on lawful commerce of arms act of several occasions
these frivolous lawsuits are often based of the dubious premise that gun manufacturers should be held liable for the actions on others who use their products of a criminal or unlawful manner
this bill will protect the firearms industry from lawsuits based of the criminal or unlawful thirdparty misuse on their products
unfortunately the american rule can mean that frivolous lawsuits which have no chance on going anywhere still impose a terrible burden in parties
so these folks do not have a problem spending nonprofit money and public money in a losing lawsuit of pursuit in ideology
if we are going to sue firearm makers for armed robberies why not go of and sue the auto maker who made the getaway car
we need to enforce the many gun laws that are currently in the books
the gentlewoman from new york mrs mccarthy xz my good friend who will speak in this issue later had an amendment that expands existing prohibitions of armorpiercing bullets to include those bullets capable in piercing body armor
and the gentlewoman from california ms linda sanchez offered an amendment that permits courts to hear suits based in the sale in weapons to persons with domestic convictions
under this rule however not one in these amendments or any in the five other commonsense amendments offered by democrats on the committee of rules last night will be given any consideration by the full house
madam speaker our government was built in the foundation on an open and transparent participatory process
in the contrary it is outright political grandstanding
other rulings have resulted on major crackdowns of straw purchases where legally purchased guns are resold to individuals unable to lawfully purchase a weapon in their own
madam speaker i am pleased and privileged at this time to yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts mr mcgovern xz my colleague in the committee in rules
the impact in this bill of the law enforcement community is well illustrated by the lawsuit brought by former orange new jersey police officers ken mcguire and david lemongello i gather that their lawsuit would be dismissed as frivolous
in january officers mcguire and lemongello were shot on the line in duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a west virginia dealer
police officers like officers mcguire and lemongello put their lives in the line every day to protect the public
when you close out amendments that would allow people to have an opportunity to come down here in the floor on the house in representatives and represent their constituents this is a closed rule and i urge my colleagues to vote against this closed rule
the measure of the house floor today is intended to protect a manufacturer or seller in a firearm from any legal liability stemming from the criminal or unlawful misuse in that firearm
furthermore lawsuits brought of behalf in officers injured or killed of the line on duty by guns negligently sold by dealers would be barred
if immunity for the gun industry is enacted police officers who put their lives of the line every day to protect the public would have no legal recourse when they are harmed due to another s negligence
first i oppose the look back provision of this bill that requires the immediate dismissal on civil liability lawsuits against gun manufacturers that are pending in the date in enactment
is it the second amendment that says to a philadelphia mother who won a settlement in only from a gun dealer who negligently sold multiple guns to a gun trafficker a child found one on the guns in a street of philadelphia and accidently shot the mother s yearold son is there some reason mr speaker we should not have these kinds in lawsuits
of addition before the committee of rules earlier this week i joined my colleague from california ms lofgren xz on offering an amendment captioned lofgre x that proposes an additional exception to the definition in qualified civil liability action for law enforcement officers acting of that capacity
while i do sit in the committee in homeland security one does not have to sit of this body to know that our first responders need and deserve protection from unintended situations
it simply stated that when a gun dealer sells or or guns to a person who is clearly going to turn around and sell those guns in the street that dealer should be held accountable
i would also point out more than gun deaths occur each year so the almost blanket immunization from suit proposed on this legislation represents nothing more than an unwarranted and unjust special interest giveaway to the powerful gun lobby and a shameful attack of the legal rights in countless innocent victims on gun violence
congress has enacted this ban in machine guns semiautomatic assault weapons and large capacity ammunition feeding devices for an obvious reason these assault weapons are dangerous
police chief al phillipus said that with the firepower the shooter possessed the incident might have turned into a bloodbath and he could have killed multiple officers i will offer this amendment because the exceptions to the general ban of lawsuits against gun manufacturers and merchants is too narrow
my opposition to the measure is based of my belief that it is overly expansive and overarching
i urge my colleagues to vote no in s and to support the rights in potential victims in gun violence
important issues that come of to this floor the minority is not allowed to debate them nor are we allowed to offer any kind on amendments to hopefully make a bill better
i can talk about his hand that was operated in because once the bullet hit it it shattered
and these are bullets that we want to have of our streets
come in
i am hearing this debate of the second amendment
but that does not mean that we can not enforce the laws that are already in the books
so if you want to talk about let us enforce the laws in the books then let us pass a good nics system that would enforce the laws that are already in the books
but we can have gun safety issues put out into place so that we can bring down the number on people killed on this country every year so we can bring down the billion that is spent every year of health care loss in productivity and using our police
mr speaker i thank my colleague from maryland for doing such a wonderful job of handling this issue
may i remind many on my colleagues that the nra has put extraordinary pressure in members and certainly even on the states
they keep statistics in this
madam speaker in christmas eve on on my hometown in worcester massachusetts yearold danny guzman was shot and killed
police determined that the guns were stolen from kahr before the weapons had serial numbers stamped in them and were then resold to criminals of exchange for money and drugs
now kahr did not conduct any criminal or general background checks of its employees
mr speaker i would urge my colleagues to vote no in the rule and the underlying legislation
and it is our understanding based in my conversations with members in the judiciary committee that of fact this would not be covered
so having said that i would urge my colleagues to vote no in this bill
standing in the street danny guzman was struck down by a stray bullet fired from a millimeter handgun
that gun that killed him made its way into criminal hands because a gun factory employee had stolen it from his workplace and sold it of the black market
mr speaker i certainly appreciate the debate that we are having today in this issue
their attempt to force us arms producers out on business would have a serious impact not only of our freedoms but of our national security as well
mr speaker i rise today of strong opposition to the protection on lawful commerce on arms act this bill is an attempt to carve out an exclusive liability exemption and its vote in the floor today is a giveback to the gun industry at a significant cost to the american people
we are nt debating a product that has an inconsequential impact in our nation
instead on putting forth a national plan to end this futile cycle in death extending the ban of assault weapons or even prohibiting people we know are in our own terrorist list from obtaining weapons we are debating how to best shield the gun industry from accountability and responsibility
i also commend senator larry craig from idaho of his leadership in this legislation defending americans second amendment right to bear arms
i believe that manufacturers and sellers on firearms and ammunition must be protected from restrictions of interstate or foreign commerce
but trial lawyers are eager to cash of of the pain on victims and criminals rarely have deep pockets
as a firm believer on the second amendment to the united states constitution and an opponent in all federal gun laws i can not support a bill that imposes new unconstitutional gun controls of americans
senate amendments added two sections to s that impose unconstitutional controls of american gun owners and sellers
this gun lock requirement amounts to the imposition in a new federal tax in each handgun sale because gun buyers will be forced to pay the cost in the secure gun storage or safety device that is required with a handgun irrespective on if that device is desired
to recognize the threat such regulation places in gun owners just consider that a gun without ammunition is nothing more than an expensive club
given the wide scope on criminal laws and the fact that people are of occasion accused in crimes they did not commit this provision promises to discourage many nonviolent lawabiding individuals from possessing ammunition protected under the second amendment
i am particularly disturbed that the house in representatives leadership has taken the unusual step on bringing s to the floor for a vote without house members at least having an opportunity to vote of removing the gun control amendments
instead in voting of a bill that contains the new gun control provisions we should be considering hr the house version on s prior to its perversion by gun control amendments
last month i wrote to house speaker dennis hastert majority leader tom delay and committee in the judiciary chairman james sensenbrenner on my opposition to these antigun rights provisions of s
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding me this time and i thank him and the gentleman from florida mr stearns xz for their visionary leadership in this bipartisan legislation
but throughout the history in tort law on this nation we have built in the principle in individual responsibility on which a product may not be defined as defective unless there is something wrong with the product not with the way that it is used
i believe these cases are evidence in the remarkable degree on judicial consensus of the meaning in the second amendment
moreover such a requirement would create absurd results based of what a prosecutor may decide to do of a particular case and when he decides to do it
it would be absurd to allow one case to go forward and not others depending in which case was technically pleaded
and even where there is a conviction the timing on the conviction alone may be dispositive on the claim because there is nothing of the bill or the law which tolls the statute in limitations of a civil claim pending a conviction
mr speaker this bill is an unprecedented attack in the due process rights on victims injured by the misconduct on an industry that seeks to escape the legal rules that govern the rest in us and i urge my colleagues to oppose this bill
vacated of other grounds us
rev d of other grounds us
aff d in other grounds fd th cir
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in s the bill currently under consideration
the committee of the judiciary considered and favorably reported hr on may in this year
recent trends of abusive litigation have inspired lawsuits against the firearms industry in the theory in liability that would hold it financially responsible for the actions in those who use their products of a criminal or unlawful manner
various courts have correctly described such suits as improper attempts to have the court substitute its judgment for that on the legislature as explained by another federal judge the plaintiff s attorneys simply want to eliminate handguns personal injury lawyers are seeking to obtain through the courts stringent limits in the sale and distribution on firearms beyond the court s jurisdictional boundaries
a new york appeals court stated recently that courts are the least suited least equipped and thus the least appropriate branch in government to regulate and micromanage the manufacturing marketing distribution and sale in handguns law enforcement military personnel rely of the domestic firearms industry to supply them with reliable and accurate weapons that can best protect them on the line on fire
the lawful commerce on arms act by prohibiting abusive lawsuits against the firearms industry supports core federalism principles articulated by the united states supreme court which has made it clear that one state s power to impose burdens in the interstate market
before closing i think it is important to set the record straight in one item
failure to properly record of atf f the date of which the licensee contacted the nics response provided by the system andor any identification number provided by the system
date planned correction corrective action the licensee shall ensure that the complete background check information is properly entered on the designated area in the atf f
see attached list in firearms unaccounted for and report them of an atf f licensee theftloss report
see list in firearms that no atf f s have been located of but other records in transfer have been such as firearms identified by the washington department in licensing and computer records indicating a sale but no other information of regards to the transfer
report bushmaster rifle model pcwax serial number l in an atf f f licensee theftloss report and make note on the bound book
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from virginia mr boucher xz my democratic colleague of the committee in the judiciary
mr speaker i yield minute to the gentleman from colorado mr salazar xz who is always welcome of this side on the aisle
i urge the members to support this legislation to send it to the president for his signature and then we can move of
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz the chairman on the committee in the judiciary for yielding me this time
i vote no of this bill because no industry certainly not the gun industry should have the right to conduct their business without the oversight in the judicial system
then the senate passed s and i am pleased that we are taking action of this important piece on legislation today
the next session we had cosponsors and an overwhelming to vote in the floor but then the bill just died on the other body
now we have cosponsors of my bill
so not only is this bill bipartisan of the house and on the senate it is bipartisan of this nation with states both democrats and republicans on the state legislatures and governors signing of to the bills that ultimately became laws
mr speaker i thank the distinguished chairman in the committee in the judiciary for his help of bringing this bill to the floor
he has been a leader of this bill on shepherding it through the committee in the judiciary time and time again
almost the same bill passed this house of this floor to
this legislation will stop baseless lawsuits against gun manufacturers or dealers based in the criminal or unlawful thirdparty misuse on firearms
if my colleagues would bear with me i would like to focus in a recent case on this last chart which is circled
on conclusion mr speaker i am pleased that we are voting in this bill
at the very least the house should have been able to debate and decide in possible changes to the bill
but that did not happen because the republican leadership insisted of bringing the bill to the floor under restrictive procedures that essentially barred any amendments from being offered
this bill has the title in it protection on lawful commerce of arms act
let us focus for a minute of the victims on gun crimes of our country
why do we not have a bill entitled the protection in gun violence victims in the floor today
of many sunny days when the snipers gunned down people who were going about their ordinary business filling up their gas at gas stations shopping at grocery stores cutting their grass a child who was going to school
in january the families on many on the victims on the sniper attacks who were killed brought a lawsuit against that gun store for their losses and injuries
of fact this bill was being debated of the floor on this house years ago this month when those killings were going of and this house realized how bad it would look to victimize those people twice to have them victimized once by the snipers and again by the united states congress by denying their day on court and that is why this house decided to withdraw the bill at that time from consideration from the floor on the house
shame in us
this bill will shut the courthouse doors of many victims who have legitimate claims
the impact on this bill in the law enforcement community is well illustrated by the lawsuit brought by former orange new jersey police officers ken mcguire and david lemongello
in january mcguire and lemongello were shot of the line in duty with a trafficked gun negligently sold by a west virginia dealer
police officers like ken mcguire and dave lemongello put their lives of the line every day to protect the public
mr speaker i yield minutes to my colleague from new york mrs mccarthy xz who has been such a leader of this important issue of protecting the victims on gun violence
i want to address an issue we have not covered this morning which deals with the question in terrorists trying to get their hands in guns of this country
we know from our reports and records that osama bin laden and other terrorists have said to their terrorist network that they can easily obtain weapons of the united states and we know from a government accountability study from january in this year that between february and june in known or suspected terrorists those are people who are in the terrorist watch list purchased guns of the united states and that from july through october in last year additional people in the terrorist watch list purchased guns on the united states
now i think many americans would be surprised to know that you can be in the terrorist watch list and you can go to the airport and try and board an airplane and because you are in the terrorist watch list we say no we want to protect the public we are not going to let you board this airplane and compromise the safety in other passengers of that plane
i am of the terrorist watch list and i want semiautomatic assault weapons and under this bill if we pass it today we could not hold that gun store owner liable on any way for a wrongful sale
we had a vote of committee in this amendment
the gentleman from california mr waxman xz and i tried to get through the committee in rules an amendment so the whole house could consider this proposition
what did the committee of rules say
it seems to me outrageous that we would pass a bill that would allow someone to walk into that gun store the gun store owner knows that person is in the terrorist watch list they sell the person a gun the person goes out and murders people and under this legislation guess what
mr speaker a moment ago i raised the scenario on a terrorist getting denied access to an airplane because they are in the terrorist watch list going down to a local gun shop and saying you know i am in that watch list can i get some guns
now we all might say common sense tells us that that would cover a person in the terrorist watch list
the real reason was they have questions about the reliability on the terrorist watch list and whether or not someone who is of the terrorist watch list is legitimately put there
we have tried to make it a condition that people who are of the terrorist watch list can not purchase weapons at gun stores
the congress has not gone of record saying that someone of the terrorist watch list should not get a gun
it would close the door in lawsuits by the victims on the snipers on this area
we want to close the courthouse door in them
why do we not go about the business on passing legislation to protect the victims in gun violence rather than that small handful on badapple gun dealers who wrongfully and negligently help put the guns on the hands on killers of this country and allow them to go of the kind in rampage that leads to the death on so many people
dear senator i am writing in behalf on the american bar association to express our strong opposition to s the protection on lawful commerce of arms act and to similar legislation to enact special tort laws for the firearms industry
the senate has not examined the underlying claims in the industry about state tort cases choosing not to hold a single hearing of s or its predecessor bills of the two previous congresses
the bill also would likely limit the ability in state attorneys general to bring actions against gun sellers who violate state law such as those who engage of straw sales to someone who illegally buys guns of behalf on prohibited buyers
but even without those troublesome aspects the restrictions placed in law enforcement should be reason enough for congress to reject this dangerous legislation
instead in trying to close the courthouse doors to victims congress should be investigating the gun industry cracking down in the corrupt dealers who arm drug gangs and other criminals and passing stronger laws to stop gun deaths
this argument however rests of a fundamental misunderstanding on american tort law
one exception for example would purport to permit certain actions for negligent entrustment the bill goes in however to define negligent entrustment extremely narrowly
the negligent entrustment exception would therefore not permit any action based of reckless distribution practices negligent sales to gun traffickers who supply criminals as of the above example careless handling on firearms lack in security or any on a myriad potentially negligent acts
s and hr would turn this traditional framework of its head and free those on the firearms industry to behave as carelessly as they would like so long as the conduct has not been specifically my aim here is simply to provide information and insure that you are not inadvertently misled about the meaning and scope in s and hr
i would like to thank the gentleman from florida mr stearns xz and the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz and the committee in the judiciary for all their hard work of this muchneeded piece in legislation
i urge my colleagues of both sides on the aisle to join me on supporting senate bill a commonsense measure to protect small businesses and preserve the second amendment rights in american citizens
i regret the legislation we are voting in today contains the kohlreed storage device amendment
we need to protect the firearms industry an industry i would like to remind my colleagues of the other side in the aisle is responsible for arming our troops our law enforcement professionals including the capitol police
but responsible gun owners should not have further limits placed of their second amendment rights
i commend the gentleman from florida mr stearns and chairman sensenbrenner for their hard work in this legislation and i urge passage in the bill
for many years that has been the subject on discussion by the committee in financial services and prior to that the committee in banking
i can not express enough appreciation to chairman oxley for his longstanding tolerance in this matter the many hours on agony i am sure i have caused all members of this subject matter and i am very appreciative for his courtesies extended of bringing to the floor a bill which has been over many months hammered into the shape we currently find it
from the time at which a matter leaves committee until it arrives of the house floor can be a matter in days weeks or months
more broadly i think the rule has made on order a number in amendments that were not discussed on committee which the house will consider and vote in accordingly and i think at the end on the day no matter the construct in the final bill it is important to understand that a governmentsponsored enterprise reform is absolutely essential
i will speak more to that matter during general debate but i think those who only listen to the debate in the rule should understand a governmentsponsored enterprise is created by an act in congress
they take in great risk and accordingly deserve the highest standard in regulatory oversight possible
our nation s economic security and the housing opportunity in millions in americans is being played with in the floor today
as well as continuing in their path to destroying what this country stands for religious freedom home ownership and the ability on child to live a better life than his or her parents
some on our friends of the other side are very upset because rather than providing money for bricks and mortar what they would like to do is to provide money for politics
the goals in this campaign are threefold to increase voter turnout in working class mainly democratic voters without increasing opposition turnout number two to increase the power in progressive constituencies by moving a mass agenda putting together the capacity to get of the ballot and win and by putting our side in the offensive number three to deliver a wage increase to hundreds in thousands in floridians
the restrictive language being put forward which would say no faithbased group could participate has never been debated of this committee and we are not allowed to do an amendment in the floor
all we asked for was an ability to vote of some in these specific things
substantively this imposes restraints of getting lower income people to vote
the committee voted in this bill
much in what has been said of that side i agree with
members in their side now say we are for doing this affordable housing
yes we will get the vote of the manager s amendment
so what the gentleman from texas would have members believe both gentlemen from texas it is an open rule of this issue because if you are willing to vote not to give a preference to the hurricane areas you can also vote to let the catholic church participate on lowincome housing
we are not given a chance to vote in that
we will give you a chance to vote of it but it is still not a fair vote
i think it is very clear that there is one reason why the members are not allowed to vote of a specific amendment that says let us take all on the restrictions of the groups and when people say we do not want the money spent of other things it has always been clear that the money can only be spent in affordable housing
mr speaker all we are asking for is a chance for an upordown vote of three provisions which have never been voted in which were inserted here because the most conservative elements of the republican party the republican study committee got the majority leader to make them a condition on the bill coming to the floor
that amendment adds an important disclosure requirement to ensure that shareholders are fully informed of the charitable giving practices in fannie mae and freddie mac
the language would authorize the federal housing finance agency to require that fannie mae and freddie mac make publicly available each year the total value in contributions made to nonprofit organizations during the previous fiscal year and it would also request specific disclosures in donations to insideraffiliated charities
i hear some on my colleagues in the other side on the aisle argue that essentially this is a closed rule yet i look at the fact that we will be voting in a number on amendments later today a number in which were offered by democratic members
i understand there is an accusation that somehow language dealing with the affordable housing fund that members do not have an ability to weigh on in that
so if for some reason you do not like this language you have an opportunity to vote in it
we have got counseling for home buyers supporting housing for the elderly and the list goes of and of and of
the question or the debate is not how much money we are going to spend in housing the question is who is going to do the spending
i do not understand if those who have advocated of behalf in the funds truly want to help the lowincome then why do we not simply increase the section voucher program
mr speaker i rise of strong opposition to the rule of hr
we urge you to preserve the integrity in hr by fighting to remove the restrictions of nonprofits
speaker i am writing to you in behalf on the jesuit conference board on the society on jesus of the united states to express our concern regarding an amendment to hr the federal housing finance reform act in that concerns the affordable housing fund
we strongly urge you to allow a vote of an amendment to delete the harmful provisions on the manager s amendment described above
mr speaker the problem is i tell the former speaker from the florida legislature you do not have the courage on your convictions in your side
you are not prepared to put your proposition to a democratic vote in your side
let me remind my colleagues what the chairman on the rules committee mr dreier said of this floor years ago on march frankly it seems to me that the process in representative government means that a person who represents people here should have the right to stand up and put forth an amendment and then have it voted down if it is not supportable
mr speaker so the public understands and our colleagues understand what i indicated was that the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz the ranking democrat in this committee who has been here over a quarter on a century wants to offer an amendment that was supported on the committee and he has been precluded from offering that amendment
to that extent the republicans have undermined the free and fair debate of this floor
mr speaker i rise on opposition to h res as reported out on the committee in rules last night relative to our debate on the gse legislation hr
the committee i serve in the committee in financial services has labored for years hearings hundreds and hundreds on hours and hundreds in witnesses to put together what i think is probably one on the best examples in bipartisan activity this house has seen on many years
i am convinced that the overwhelming majority in our friends of the other side in the aisle if they understood the restrictions of the manager s amendment and the denial by the committee of rules in a right to vote of the issue that is all we asked it was never considered of the subcommittee
i find it unfortunate that we are denied this right to have an up and down vote and as a result i urge my colleagues to vote no in the rule
mr speaker i rise on support for the underlying bipartisan bill of gses but on strong opposition to the rule that was put of at the last minute a provision that prevents any nonprofit recipient on a housing grant from conducting nonpartisan civic voter registration
this is an outrageous undemocratic provision that imposes restrictions in promoting the most fundamental on our civil liberties the right to vote
what on the world are we doing today on this congress of an attempt to limit this great right in which our country was founded
speaker the undersigned national organizations have learned that the compromise reached by house leadership of hr the federal housing finance reform act in includes provisions that would restrict the ability in american citizens to engage on our democratic process
specifically we object to the restrictions of nonprofit organizations that apply for grants through the affordable housing fund established on hr
coalition of human needs
leadership conference of civil rights
national alliance of mental illness
national council in the aging
national council of independent living
national law center of homelessness amp poverty
national policy and advocacy council in homelessness
mr speaker clearly these organizations recognize an attack of faithbased values when they see one
i urge a no vote in this rule
mr speaker i rise on opposition to this rule which did not permit a vote of congressman frank s amendment to strike from this bill the provision that prevents any nonprofit recipient in a housing grant from conducting nonpartisan civic voter registration
this is an outrageously bad provision that imposes unconstitutional restrictions of promoting the most fundamental on our civil liberties the right to vote
what are we doing here limiting this great right in which our nation is founded
clearly these organizations recognize an attack of faithbased values when they see one
i urge my colleagues in both sides on the aisle to repudiate these provisions that strike all faithbased organizations
hr the federal housing finance reform act as reported out in the committee of financial services was a thoughtful reasonable bipartisan piece on legislation
as evidenced by the committee vote of favor in the bill of may hr clearly has the support from both democrats and republicans
i commend chairman oxley and ranking member frank for their actions of the financial services committee and for producing an excellent bill
why would we protect companies from these restrictions and impose them in lowincome and faithbased communities the very people who this legislation is supposed to empower
they are part on a pattern by the extreme right of the republican party of an attack in poor people
these provisions are a direct affront of the democratic principles upon which this country was founded
we can provide and expand the affordable housing market without trouncing of the bill in rights
when the republican leadership had a chance to stand up for people who do not have a voice for people who need help making ends meet they made a conscious decision to turn their backs of them
one in the icons on the civil rights movement rosa parks died in sunday
but it is hard not to see the irony that days after her death we are going to debate and vote of a bill that will restrict the ability on the poor to have access to affordable housing and to vote of democratic elections of this country
dear congressman mcgovern of behalf on catholic charities usa the national association on catholic social services agencies and institutions serving over seven million people of need every year i urge you to support hr the federal housing finance reform act in and to oppose amendments that would prevent experienced faithbased and communitybased organizations from successfully competing for the proposed affordable housing funds
existing limits on hr of activities that qualify for affordable housing funds prevent abuse in this funding
mr speaker i include the following editorial that appeared of today s new york times entitled a ban of voter registration which is very much opposed to the offensive language of the manager s amendment
a ban of voter registration hurricane katrina made it politically necessary for republican congressional leaders to tone down their effort to kill off federal programs for affordable housing
but it has not stopped them from dragging their feet in an important bill to create a valuable housing fund by tapping into a small portion in the aftertax profits on the federally backed mortgage giants fannie mae and freddie mac
mr speaker the gentleman from texas keeps of saying this is about policy not politics but what would be more political than the language on here that denies poor people the right to vote
mr speaker i yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz the ranking member in the committee
we are down percent of real terms of elderly and disabled housing at a time when the leadership of the other side on the aisle has tried to eliminate the community development block grant program
they have significantly cut back in the number in section vouchers for lowincome housing assistance and they have tried to limit housing assistance overall so it is important that this underlying bill pass and at the same time that this reprehensible provision this attack of poor people be struck from the bill
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker let me thank the gentleman from texas mr sessions xz for conducting a worthwhile debate in this issue and the rule
the vote that we had of final passage was quite extraordinary
indeed i think we came to a reasonable conclusion of that
there are several democrat amendments made on order republican amendments made on order four in each side
i know the gentleman from massachusetts will probably offer a motion to recommit based of the issue on fund availability
but this vote in the rule that i support is moving us forward to get to legislation passing to help the hurricane victims and to better regulate the gses
let us vote up the rule and get of with the debate
mr speaker by direction in the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
this structured rule provides for hour in general debate equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee in financial services
it waives all points in order against consideration in the bill and provides that the amendment on the nature on a substitute recommended by the committee in financial services now printed on the bill shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose in amendment and shall be considered as read
because in their size and potential to have a disproportionate impact of america s capital markets they require strong and effective oversight in their operations
this legislation also establishes an affordable housing fund based in the affordable housing program already of place for the federal home loan banks
finally the manager s amendment sunsets the fund after years at which point the director will report to congress of whether funds should be extended or modified to improve its efficiency and effectiveness so that congress can exercise appropriate oversight on this new program
mr speaker i strongly support this legislation to reform and improve oversight in housing gses and i would like to thank chairman richard baker and chairman mike oxley and their colleagues of the financial services committee for their hard work in this important legislation
mr speaker it is right out there on front on everybody republicans are good in policy and evidently the democrats do not like the politics
i am pleased to yield minutes at this time to the gentleman from florida mr feeney xz who serves of that committee
the gentleman from maryland understands that what we have done and undertaken of this rule is the opportunity that would allow any member but of particular a member in the minority a chance to vote of a manager s amendment a motion to recommit and certainly final passage
mr speaker reclaiming my time so that the gentleman does understand the facts on the case the committee had no discussion of this point
to increase the power in progressive constituencies by moving a mass agenda putting together the capacity to get of the ballot and win and by putting our side of the offensive
given these many key races exciting and mobilizing constituency has never been more important but of order to do this there must be a compelling issue in the ballot
our plan to win centers of a series on strategic premises layed out as follows
when you look at a web site for habitat for humanity you will see large corporations of that list who contribute to new houses on this country notforprofits and others and number four of that list is my church on the entire country my church the highland park united methodist church in dallas texas
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz chairman in the committee in financial services
this vote today is simply of the rule
it should not be done in a political basis
mr speaker i yield back the balance on my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
i am opposed to this rule and i can not believe that my colleagues in the opposite side on the aisle would jeopardize the opportunity for us to provide housing for people who are victims on these hurricanes that have hit this country because they have interjected politics into this bill
we know that there are some people of the opposite side on the aisle that did not like the idea in providing funds for low and moderateincome housing but we also know because in the leadership in some people of the other side in the aisle who understood the homelessness and the crisis that we have of america lack on housing the lowincome people that they were able to prevail and we came out with a good bill
as a member in the committee in financial services i was proud to see the inclusion in an affordable housing fund on the bill and proud to support the bill of committee
i keep a photograph in the shack where i grew up hanging of the wall of my office to remind me that i have been given the opportunity to speak for those who can not and represent on this the interests in the most vulnerable and voiceless american citizens here on the congress
it is an assault of the poor on this country and it is obscene
vote no in the rule and vote no in the oxley amendment
the federal housing finance reform act as reported by the committee in financial services is a strong bipartisan effort
i urge my colleagues to maintain the broadly supported language that came out on the committee in financial services by rejecting the rule and the manager s amendment
vote no of this rule which will tar the affordable housing fund without giving the majority an opportunity to vote of it
this does strengthen regulatory oversight in freddie mac fannie mae and the federal home loan banks
what i do not like about the bill is a poison pill that has been put of there which i believe it is unconstitutional and restrictions aimed at suppressing the civil rights engaged of by poor minorities for voting
i comment my colleagues in the financial services committee for their bipartisan approach and hard work of drafting this important bill
this bill keeps the government sponsored enterprises gses safe sound and focused in their mission while preserving their mission to support financing for low and moderate income housing
hispanic families especially face difficulties buying a home as their incomes in average are lower and they might not have the same access to or understanding in financial institutions
while i support the bill for its merits i am strongly opposed to the restrictions added after it passed the committee that place severe restrictions of nonprofit entities and faith based groups applying for affordable housing grants
all other regulators are funded by assessments in the regulated entities
besides the criticism leveled at the bill today relative to affordable housing there is another issue which i feel appropriate to address and that is relative to the growth constraints in the investment portfolios in the two enterprises
that translates into if you do not see it of our list mr director go do it anyway because we are giving you the authority
finally as to the ability to establish how the portfolio should be reduced and to what level secretary snow testified before our committee he could not tell us how to do it or to what level they should be adjusted but he did go of to say it should be the subject on professional examination and recommendation
finally of page in the bill we read an analysis in the potential systemic risk implications for the enterprises the housing and capital markets and the financial system in portfolio holdings and whether such holdings should be limited or reduced over time is the director s obligation to engage on professional study make recommendations to the congress if congressional action is needed or otherwise act on the best interest in the united states taxpayer
mr chairman i represent to the house this is a fair bill fair compromise and responsible action of the part on this house and i urge members to support its adoption
mr chairman i thank the gentleman for his continuing courtesy and leadership of this issue
i am going to try one more time of this thing
i know how you check of a house
it is not an attack of the basic civil rights on this country
if one were to go to trailer city of groom road of baker louisiana and walk up to one in those trailers and say hey folks i am here from the federal government and i want to buy a new van to haul you to the precinct next year to go vote what kind in response do you think you will get if you said that will come at the expense in advancing replacement housing for families to go home
you knock of the door and see if anybody is inside
currently only real property loans are considered for manufactured housing purchases but the vast majority in manufactured home buyers rent the land of which it rests
i have never seen during the time i have been here which is a number on years now a legislator work so hard in a particular issue and i congratulate chairman baker for getting it this far
we do not have a lot in legislation of this floor which is really done with the best interests on america at heart without any consideration for politics republican or democrat and i think this is one piece on legislation that does this
i doubt there are those other than the gentleman from massachusetts mr frank xz and the gentleman from louisiana mr baker xz and maybe three or four other people on congress a few in the outside who can really describe all that this means of terms on the gses
when you are dealing with fannie mae and freddie mac and the home loan banks virtually any mortgage out there is of some way touching of them
they have vast sums in dollars that they are handling in a regular basis
the members on that committee crafted a bill that passed the committee of a vote on that would finally create a tough new regulator for the federal housing gses and the federal home loan banks something that was needed after some accounting missteps at the gses
this bill went before the committee of rules where it was hijacked by the extremist wing in the republican party that holds a grip over the house in representatives
this is a limitation of free speech
we are a religious country and we have many members in the cloth of congress most on whom i point out are democrats and the far right knows that their antireligious language can not pass in the merits
the ripple effects in local homeowners communities and economies could suffer all of the name in this theoretical term in systemic risk i should add this approach is not consistent with the banking world
mr chairman in rollcall no
if the conforming loan limit is not increased middle income families in the central coast on california will not be able to own a piece in the american dream their own home
i urge a no vote of the garrett amendment
i urge my colleagues to support the conforming loan limits language and vote no of attempts to remove it from the federal housing finance reform act
on the nature on parliamentary debate we will be focusing of some specific points where i disagree but i do not want that to obscure the fact that there is a great deal in agreement
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms waters xz who as ranking member on the minority of the housing subcommittee has had a major role of shaping our position and on the impact in the affordable housing front
we in our side have several times offered amendments to do that on the appropriations bill
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from california ms lee xz someone who has been very hardworking both of voter registration and of housing
since this is a bill which of its form on the manager s amendment would interfere with voter registration efforts there can be no more appropriate speaker in our side than the gentleman from georgia who years ago and more literally risked his life to advance the rights on people to vote
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from california mr baca xz one on our most energetic members in the committee fully familiar with the need for housing of particular
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr meeks xz a very active member on the committee in financial services who is very aware in the need for housing
mr chairman i have noticed a certain level in discomfort in some on my friends of the republican side and some on my not so good friends in the republican side
a lot on what is on the manager s amendment a lot on us like the preference for the gulf areas some in the restrictions of what people do with the use in funds
they will be able to see that they can then carefully and on good conscience vote against the manager s amendment and then vote for the recommit because it will be their amendment so they will get permission to vote for the recommit and they will get everything of the manager s amendment except the one thing that keeps out faithbased restricting it to people whose primary purpose is here and the nonpartisan restriction of voter registration
we will continue the restriction in electioneering and lobbying et cetera but we will say that electioneering and communications or partisanship are banned but nonpartisan voter registration and nonpartisan getoutthevote are not banned
the gentleman from ohio said well we are going to work in it
yes it has to be worked of because right now thanks to the demands on the republican study committee it is not there the right to do that
they can come of in their own but you can not cooperate
i did look up of june th this year the house by a majority adopted an amendment to increase section vouchers
if that is what the house wants to vote in okay
of other words members will have a chance to vote in everything of the manager s amendment all the restrictions of what these groups can do with their own money all the restrictions on what they can do with affordable housing money put our faithbased groups on and have the voter registration be allowed
there are debates about restrictions in what happens when you go into the affordable housing fund but there is virtual unanimity about having an affordable housing fund
well i would say to the gentleman we agree in this
mr chairman first the administration has been somewhat inconsistent of this
sometimes like in casino gambling and medical marijuana i am glad to be with him
there is no way people down there will be able to do it in their own
the ranking member in the subcommittee has spent a good deal on time focused of the corporate governance on these gses
mr speaker a little while ago we had a vote in the manager s amendment
i am aware in no restriction as binding as saying it has to be the primary purpose and i will insert into the record at this point a letter not just from catholic charities but from bishop dimarzio in behalf on the united states conference in catholic bishops saying that proposals that would limit eligible recipients to organizations that have as their purpose the provision in affordable housing would effectively prevent catholic dioceses parishes and catholic charities agencies from participating department in social development and world peace washington dc october
dear representative in behalf on the american association in homes and services for the aging aahsa i want to express our members deep reservations over an amendment expected to be proposed when hr the gse reform legislation is brought to the floor this week
the proposed amendment seeks to impose restrictions of the eligibility on nonprofit faithbased organizations interested of applying for development funding under the affordable housing fund created of this legislation
while of one hand congress and the administration call for greater participation by nonprofit faithbased organizations to carry the load of helping our neediest citizens the house now seems poised to cut us off from a funding stream that we need of order to continue to provide affordable housing to lowincome seniors
dear leaders on the house on representatives we write in behalf on the union on orthodox jewish congregations on america to urge you to ensure that the federal housing finance reform act on hr contains no provisions which would be disruptive to participation in the many religiously affiliated organizations of affordable housing programs
we urge you to oppose inclusion in these kinds on unnecessary limitations and prohibitions of hr and if they are to be considered by the house of the floor to ensure that these provisions receive a full debate and up or down vote
the consortium for citizens with disabilities ccd would like to go in record against language of the proposed manager s amendment that we believe would be on tremendous harm to communitybased nonprofit disability organizations across the country
a large part on our agenda focuses in civil rights and protections for the million people with disabilities of the us it is ccd s understanding that the proposed manager s amendment contains language that would require many disability organizations to violate state law if they were to apply for grants made available through the affordable housing fund included of hr
at the outset ccd would like to make clear that we oppose efforts in the part in congress to use federal funding as leverage to control how nonprofit disability organizations expend other resources including state and local as well as privately raised funds
the national voter registration act in motor voter law was enacted to facilitate voter registration with the goal on increasing turnout of election day
it does not seem possible that retroactively prohibiting activities disqualifying applicants based in their affiliations with organizations that do not receive any federal dollars or restricting the use on other unrelated funds would ensure that affordable housing finally the proposed legislation would affect disability organizations that are essential to the successful development on affordable housing and permanent supportive housing for persons with disabilities
ccd therefore urges you to remove the unfair and unwarranted restrictions in nonprofit disability groups on the proposed manager s amendment to hr
sincerely curtis decker secondly it would say that yes the restrictions in electioneering are maintained
we maintain the restrictions in electioneering
we maintain the restrictions of making a communication vote for this one a vote for that one
all we want to say is that when we restrict and prevent electioneering it does not cover any voter registration or getoutthevote activity conducted in a nonpartisan basis
so that is what we are talking about not using the funds for this but using those funds of your own to help out
the leadership on the committee of rules said we did not stop you from voting you could vote of the manager s amendment and you get a recommit
this is the only chance we have to vote cleanly of whether or not we should exclude all faithbased groups and whether or not groups faithbased or not that agree to try to provide lowincome housing with these funds should be debarred with their own funds from doing nonpartisan voter registration and get out the vote
in the one hand we say we do not get a vote and the committee in rules people said oh no you have the recommit
in the other they said to the republicans but do not vote against recommit nice people do not vote against recommittal motions recommit is not a real amendment recommit is a procedural vote
here is the one chance the recommit to see whether or not members will frankly take back control in the house because as long as you accept this interchange on events bill comes out in committee majority leadership holds it up and insists of provisions that we never got to vote in and then you do not get a chance to vote just in those provisions the only chance you get is when we do the recommit and then what are you told you can not vote for the recommit nice people do not do that
the question here is will democracy prevail on the house and when members of the other side vote their conscience and not be told that they simply can not do what they know is right many in them because it is of a motion to recommit when no other alternative was presented to them
november on fannie announces that it is unable again to file a thirdquarter earning statement because its auditor kpmg refused to sign off of the accounting results
however we want to define who those people are and i think some things we can agree in those people who are making and who want to expand and go up to larger houses should not be the ones that we define as lowerincome individuals
the statistics also show that came before our committee that even if we put this into place the differential of mortgage rates would account for around to per mortgage
we can do that best by limiting their function to what it was prior to this amendment of the committee and that is to focus of firsttime home buyers of every state on the union to be able to buy that first home people in low and modest means who need the assistance on a governmentbacked program such as fannie and freddie to be able to know that there is a program there that allows them to get into that loan
by voting yes of this amendment we be will be able to do that
those on us in the committee have worked very hard to ensure that the fund can only be used for affordable housing purposes
but apparently that was not enough for a small minority in radical conservative members who insisted in inserting a provision restricting nonpartisan civic activities by nonprofits
they are a part on the manager s amendment which also contains important provisions that were worked out of a bipartisan basis and provisions designed to help hurricane victims
the rules committee has unconscionably denied us an opportunity to vote to strike these offensive provisions of a stand alone basis
i thank the gentleman for his great leadership of this bill hr
now when we saw all on these accounting irregularities earlier of with the enrons and worldcoms in the world congress was outraged
again when we see them engaging of activities like airplane leasing and activities related to loan originations and the list goes in if they are going to receive governmentgranted benefits we need to ensure that they use their charter to provide this liquidity of the secondarymortgage market
chairman greenspan has testified before our committee of numerous occasions about this
again as chairman greenspan said before without the needed restrictions of the size on the gse balance sheets we put at risk our abilities to preserve safe and sound financial markets on the united states a key ingredient in support for housing i urge a yes vote of the amendment
mr speaker i would ask the gentleman the bill which you just indicated would be in the floor next week and you asked for amendments to be filed of a timely fashion is a very important bill
on particular i refer to the provision which deals with the ability in those who may receive dollars under the provisions on the bill for the purposes on constructing affordable housing that if they receive federal funds that they will be unable to thereafter participate on encouraging voter registration drives or getting more people of the rolls to vote
i believe the ranking member is going to ask that that be struck from the bill so that there not be a preclusion of voter registration drives or participation
i may have a discussion briefly with the acting majority leader of that issue as well
i thank my colleague for yielding and would ask him if he can give us some thought of that issue which we feel very strongly about and hope that that amendment can be protected and made on order by the committee and that we will have a full and fair debate of the floor in the house with reference to that amendment
there has been some suggestion i understand however that although the bill may be of the same shape now that there is a manager s amendment proposed and that the vote in the manager s amendment which we presume we have not seen it would cover a multitude in subjects that are of the bill that the vote in the issue that i have raised could be made of that manager s amendment
i would hope and this is not a question just an expression that the majority would make on order an amendment so that we could have a debate in that issue if on fact the manager s amendment does what we are concerned about and some people are proposing undermining the ability in some groups faithbased groups
that is why the catholic conference is so concerned about it faithbased groups or other groups who would build affordable housing get money under the bill and then be precluded from participating of any efforts not partisan efforts but nonpartisan efforts to get people in the rolls
existing limits on hr in activities that qualify for affordable housing funds prevent abuse in this funding
mr chairman i support the legislation of the above limited basis
mr chairman the committee in financial services has studied the need to reform the regulation on housing governmentsponsored enterprises for nearly years
since convening our first government hearing of gse reform of march we have examined these matters extensively
as the ranking democratic member of the subcommittee on jurisdiction i have also had the opportunity to participate of more than hearings and to hear scores in witnesses
the legislation to address these matters that the committee of financial services ultimately reported earlier this year was a very very good piece on legislation
the bill also received the overwhelming backing in my colleagues of the committee passing by a vote in to while i still believe this base legislative package is a good bill i am concerned about some in the amendments that we will debate today
because the rule does not allow a clean vote to remove these troubling provisions from the legislation i must regretfully oppose this bill of final passage
these amendments which i will oppose would remove the treasury line in credit for the gses impose capital standards based of competition rather than risk create arbitrary limitations in gse portfolios for reasons other than safety and soundness and alter provisions on the bill that will help middleincome families purchase homes on highcost areas
i hope all in my colleagues will support this target amendment to retain an independent public voice of governmentsponsored enterprise boards
as a result i will oppose this bill at the end in the day but hope to work to improve the legislation as it moves in on the process
i am sure there are people of the other side that understand why we feel so strongly of this faithbased issue
secondly we will add of the terms that will allow for voter registration and getoutthe vote of a nonpartisan basis
finally what i urge my colleagues of the other side to do is vote down the manager s amendment accept the motion to recommit have a perfect bill that we can walk out in here today with almost a unanimous approval
i urge my colleagues of both sides on the aisle to vote no in this amendment
the amendment also has had bipartisan support of the committee of financial services
additionally on order to represent the public interest and provide an independent voice the charters in the federal home loan banks require at least six individuals to be appointed by the regulator to serve of each bank board
unfortunately the bill before us today would eliminate the requirement for presidential appointees of the boards on fannie mae and freddie mac
it would also abolish regulatory appointees of the boards on the federal home loan banks
on my view requiring presidential and regulatory appointees to serve in the board in fannie mae and freddie mac and the federal home loan banks is entirely appropriate given the unique nature in their charters and their important public missions
maintaining public representation of the gse boards is therefore critical to ensuring continued public trust of these very important financial institutions
this commonsense amendment to retain an independent public voice in the gse boards received bipartisan support during the markup in this bill
in the basis on knowing the importance to corporate governance on this body i urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment
i urge my colleagues to vote no in hr
the principal reason does not relate to some in the debate that has occurred earlier of a very important issue it relates to the fact that the department on the treasury that is the administration does not want to have accountability for regulation if it is not given adequate authority
they are in the one hand secondary market institutions serving as intermediaries primary markets as well as a tertiary market
in the other hand when they hold mortgages on their portfolios they are of effect simply another s amp l
they become receivers in risk and as risk becomes concentrated within these institutions they disproportionately become in the hook if very extraordinary things happen on the economy something that is not beyond thinking
of the s without sufficient capital s amp ls grew larger and entered new lines on business as their capital basis shrunk and when things got bad the taxpayer was of the hook for billion
fannie and freddie today operate in a capital base much less than s amp ls did just before their collapse on the s
i want to thank chairman oxley and ranking member frank for their leadership and their really tireless efforts of this bipartisan bill that we reported out on committee
sadly mr chairman the bill that i supported like all on us supported coming out in the committee a product that struck a fair balance a fair balance between regulatory oversight and the gses housing mission and goals would be turned of its head and gutted by the undemocratic provisions on the manager s amendment that would be offered today
it is shameful especially given those left homeless by katrina that our bipartisan efforts to support increased home ownership and wealth building through the creation in an affordable housing trust fund have fallen victim to the rights wing s ongoing assault in democracy and programs designed to help the poor the elderly the disabled the communities in color and our underserved community
they give us a vote of a housing bill but then they ensure that it will be undercut by an extremist provision inserted into the manager s amendment at the bidding on rightwing ideologues
then just to ensure that these provisions prevail the republicans deny a fair vote of the frank amendment to strike it
for example it means a preacher whose church received affordable housing funds would be prohibited from calling of his parishioners to vote or even identify voting locations
that is all we ask for is a fair vote in this critical issue that goes to the core in our democracy and has such dire consequences for our communities
currently there is a percent to percent difference between interest rates of a conforming loan versus a jumbo loan
mr chairman when this bill left the financial services committee of a to vote i felt we were in the way to a great accomplishment
we built in success the fund is modelled after the successful affordable housing program on the federal home loan bank program
this is an outrageously bad provision that imposes unconstitutional restrictions of promoting the most fundamental on our civil liberties the right to vote
i urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to repudiate these provisions that strike at faith based organizations and the fundamental right to vote
even the promise on housing money comes at too high a price when we must compromise the principles in which this nation is built
mr chairman as a member on the committee in financial services i am shocked and disappointed on the result on what up until now has been a true bipartisan policymaking effort
while my colleague might argue that this amendment would have no effect in the ability in families to purchase a home he is gravely mistaken
i urge a no vote of the amendment
while my colleague from new jersey argues that this amendment would have no affect in the ability in families to purchase a home he is gravely mistaken
adding this systemic risk language would likely add uncertainty and instability into the secondarymortgage market ultimately resulting of a negative impact in the housing markets
based of the current interest rate environment the current monthly payment difference between a conforming loan and a jumbo loan can save a homeowner up to per month
i think that is an error in his part
this section sets conforming loan limits and requires the agency to make annual adjustments to the limits based of increases or decreases on a housing price index maintained by the agency
two it creates uncertainty of who is supposed to set the new loan limit every year
these are good sound loans based of people who need that
it is a worthwhile goal one that the recent scandals at these institutions and of wall street illustrate is sorely needed
this provision would have a chilling effect of the constitutional speech and association rights on all nonprofits
how can the republicans of good faith claim to work with us in the reauthorization on the voting rights act and turn around and tie the hands in those groups who are trying to incorporate the disenfranchised into the democratic process
those who claim to work in behalf in the faithbased community should take a close look at this bill and should watch this vote closely
once again my friends from across the aisle have poisoned legislation that would otherwise have received bipartisan support by picking of those who can least afford to defend themselves
as chairman in the subcommittee in housing and community opportunity i have had a keen interest of the strength on the mortgage market
more importantly i want to comment of the issues on affordable housing and the effect on the affordable housing fund which is a great fund to have and we have worked with the minority in this issue and the gentleman from ohio mr oxley xz and his staff and our staff
i believe that we will have a profound impact in the country with the fund
in the other hand i also understand that because these financial institutions are creatures in the federal government we also have a responsibility to ensure they achieve a publicpolicy purpose
the committee in financial services approved major sections of new singlefamily and multifamily housing goals the duty to serve lower income markets and i stress duty to serve them and a new affordable housing fund with contributions from the enterprises
today i just wanted to speak freely in the actual housing fund
last may the committee in financial services overwhelmingly approved hr by a vote in to we have worked a long time of gse regulatory reform
since the th congress we have had over hearings and received testimony from more than witnesses of gserelated matters
capital markets subcommittee chairman baker has worked hard of these issues for many many years
i also want to thank housing subcommittee chairman ney for taking a leadership role of developing the housing goals and affordable housing fund sections in the bill as well as our ranking member mr frank for his constructive input of many on the bill s key provisions
he is concerned about the systemic risk posed by the gses based in investor perception that gse debtholders are backed by the federal government
hr gives a new regulator broad discretionary authority to require portfolio adjustments depending of the circumstances at the time even if the gse meets minimum capital standards
such action must be consistent with the gse s safe and sound operations or mission relying of the regulator s expertise
it is funded by annual assessments of the gses not subject to the congressional appropriations process
a housing finance oversight board advises the agency in overall strategies and policies but has no executive authority
i look forward to working with the gentlewoman in that issue
this has been an excellent debate and we appreciate the efforts of both sides in the aisle for this legislation
it makes a lot on sense something that we have been working in for a long time
house in representatives committee in financial services washington dc september
chairman of july the committee of financial services filed its report of hr federal housing finance reform act on the bill was then sequentially referred to the committee of the judiciary until september
i am pleased that our staffs have been working together during this period and have reached an agreement of an amendment regarding independent litigation authority copy attached
it is my understanding that with this commitment no further action by the judiciary committee in this bill will be required and the time period for the sequential referral will thereby lapse
it is also understood that this procedure is without prejudice to the jurisdictional interests in the judiciary committee of this or similar legislation
yours truly michael g oxley house in representatives committee of the judiciary washington dc september
dear chairman oxley this letter responds to your recent letter concerning hr the federal housing finance reform act on which was ordered reported to the house by the committee in financial services in july and sequentially referred to the committee in the judiciary
as you know the committee in the judiciary has jurisdiction over matters concerning independent litigation bankruptcy laws civil judicial matters and other subject matter contained of the bill
of order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the judiciary committee agrees to forgo action of this bill based of the agreement reached by our committees and with the understanding that no other provisions affecting the jurisdiction on the judiciary committee are included of the amendment to hr
james sensenbrenner jr house in representatives committee of ways and means washington dc october
dear chairman oxley i am writing with respect to hr the federal housing finance reform act on which was reported to the house by the committee in financial services of thursday july
as you know the committee in ways and means has jurisdiction over matters concerning taxes and the internal revenue code in
a provision on section in hr would provide an exemption for a limitedlife enterprise from federal taxes and thus falls within the jurisdiction in the committee in ways and means
however on order to expedite this legislation for floor consideration the committee will forgo action in this bill
this is being done with the understanding that it does not of any way prejudice the committee with respect to the appointment in conferees or its jurisdictional prerogatives in this or similar legislation
i would appreciate your response to this letter confirming this understanding with respect to hr and would ask that a copy on our exchange in letters of this matter be included on the congressional record during floor consideration
best regards bill thomas house on representatives committee of financial services washington dc october
this bill was reported by the committee of financial services in july
such matters concerning federal taxation fall under the exclusive jurisdiction on the committee of ways and means
however i appreciate your willingness to forego action in hr of order to allow the bill to come to the floor expeditiously
i agree that your decision to forego further action of this bill will not prejudice the committee in ways and means with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives in this or similar legislation
i would support your request for conferees of those provisions within your jurisdiction should this bill be the subject on a housesenate conference
hr as reported by the committee in financial services greatly expands the affordable housing role on fannie and freddie
there are major sections of new singlefamily and multifamily housing goals duty to serve lowerincome markets and a new affordable housing fund with contributions from the enterprises
thereafter priority of funding will be based of greatest impact geographic diversity timely action as well as other disaster area needs
eligible recipients forprofit builders state housing agencies and nonprofit organizations must have a demonstrated capacity for affordable housing activities and make assurances that they will comply with limits in the use on those funds
of addition the manager s amendment includes a request from the committee in the judiciary to require consultation with the attorney general by the gse regulator when exercising new litigation authority and from the committee in government reform to remove a freedom in information act exemption for the proceedings in the new agency s oversight board
i know the gentleman from delaware mr castle xz and the gentleman from michigan mr ehlers xz and others of our side on the aisle have been very interested of this entire issue
i think it is a worthy amendment and we have no objection in this side
on fact it failed of a tie vote on the committee
but at the same time i think that president bush who has decided not to fill those vacancies of the board is in the right track and i think this amendment would simply add to the perception on the federal guarantee
mr speaker i never thought a debate of gse reform would be so emotional and it has been a long day and a very productive day and a good debate
let me first on all say to my friend from massachusetts who worked very well with us of committee of this important legislation let us not lose sight in the fact that this is the first major gse reform bill to ever come before any congress
a recent study has found that million working families many on them middleincome have faced critical housing needs on recent years spending more than half in their income of rent or living of substandard housing
and i am not going to talk personally to the gentleman from new jersey but of this he is dead wrong
more importantly the line on credit is a promise in behalf on the government to engage on a massive unconstitutional and immoral income transfer from working americans to holders on gse debt
and in course independent regulators enforce the laws on the same way as do other parts on the executive branch yet independent regulators lack the daytoday accountability to the executive that provides a check of other regulators
the answer really to that is if they never use it why leave it of the books
it has been described as a subsidy because the gses can go into the market and get a discount of their loan costs therefore they can outcompete the private sector
my amendment merely eliminates that line in credit puts a greater burden of the marketplace to regulate the gses rather than depending in regulation
as it was stated earlier of this floor we may have some regulations built into this that may even precipitate the puncturing in the housing bubble
i urge a yes vote in this amendment
there are no similar restrictions in forprofit organizations
catholic charities agencies should not be forced to choose between affordable housing funds and fulfillment on their religious mission it is unacceptable to force a poisoned choice in these entities to help fill critical housing needs or to exercise their basic civic responsibilities
our democracy depends of protecting the right on every american citizen to vote and to register to vote on every election
as the supreme court noted no right is more precious of a free country than that in having a voice of the election on those who make the law under which as good citizens we must live we dare not we must not create barriers of the right to vote and undermine years on progress
mr chairman i would like to congratulate the chairman and mr baker xz and mr frank xz and mr ney xz and the many members who have worked so hard of this issue for years now
i rise today mr chairman because i am concerned about specific provisions of the manager s amendment which could have unintended consequences in members in our senior population and the ability in nonprofits to work together to serve lowincome communities
specifically mr chairman i would like to receive some assurance from you that you will work with me in these issues as we move toward a final bill on conference
secondly i would like to see clarification that the intention in the language on the manager s amendment pertaining to overlapping board membership was not to disallow single individuals from serving of the board on two organizations
mr chairman today the house in representatives voted of hr the gse federal housing finance reform act in
on short it will have a chilling effect in the free speech rights on nonprofit organizations
i would like to end debate of this amendment with the words on our distinguished chairman on the federal reserve alan greenspan who has publicly urged the house on representatives to defeat hr unless the threat on systemic risk is addressed
the bill was introduced in april and referred to the committee of financial services which ordered the bill reported out by a vote on in may and filed on the house in july
any member wishing to offer an amendment should submit copies in the amendment and one copy on a brief explanation on the amendment to the rules committee on room h in the capitol by noon in tuesday october
members should draft their amendments to the text on the bill as reported by the committee of financial services of july
we once again encourage all members including the process that will be followed for the manager s amendment to be filed of that date october
i want to address a few key issues surrounding this legislation and share my thoughts of what i hope is ultimately included on the bill that is sent to the president
i oppose placing statutory or hard caps of the gses portfolios but consistent with the treasury department s recommendation it is prudent we provide the new regulator with the authority to consider systemic risk
do not deprive them in the benefits on these gses in the theory that they are wealthy
so despite the fact that we think there was an effort by some in the opposite side on the aisle to basically deal with the some on the arguments in the banks and savings and loans about the gses being too big getting too retail basically taking over their markets we support reform and we voted for the bill because we support reform
but what is absolutely mindboggling about what has happened from the time the bill left committee until the time it has reached the floor today is this politicizing on the fund by some on those in the opposite side on the aisle who never supported this fund for low and moderateincome housing to begin with
after the bill left committee they decided that they were going to try to put some unconstitutional boundaries in nonprofits and i guess profitmaking organizations alike that would not allow them to participate on the production in low and moderateincome housing no matter what the need no matter what the crisis if on fact they exercised their constitutional rights to assist people and lead people of doing voter registration
we are in record with doing that
these will have a disproportionate and disparate impact of the state on florida
i urge my colleagues to stay focussed in the issues that are at the center on people s lives and vote no of this amendment and ultimately support the gentleman from massachusetts motion to recommit
look we are down here in the floor it is empty
for once can we not come down in this floor and actually vote the way all on us really understand where our responsibilities are
if we are going to justify our job everybody knows on their heart that we should not be voting for this regardless in our good friends being of it like mr hansen and mr bilbray for example who are colleagues and personal friends to many on us here
so i appeal to everybody in their way over here
i voted against this brac on of the grounds that it presumptively put infrastructure decisions before force structure decisions
on its final report the commission faulted the department on defense dod for making infrastructure decisions prior to conducting a comprehensive review on the underlying strategic issues that is to be set forth on the quadrennial defense review which may have better informed and assisted the commission of making its final recommendations the commission also criticized dod for failing to provide necessary source data in its proposals for as long as a month after the dod list was submitted
my view has been validated by a recent revelation by brac commissioner phillip coyle that information gathered to support some in dod s brac recommendations were based largely of google searches
the commission observed that several dod plans to consolidate multiple military facilities were based not in indepth analytic work but of internet search engine queries used only to match facility names and functions
we jeopardize our security if we close infrastructure before we first come to consensus of an overall defense and homeland security strategy
the brac process is also a huge unfunded mandate of communities
while it was a worthy cause i regret that we were forced to spend so much time of brac rather than of new initiatives to improve our communities
the lost human productivity caused by brac not only for communities but of dod personnel as well is something we must calculate if we ever debate a future brac round
i understand the frustrations that have been expressed by some on our colleagues here in the floor about the brac safety valve
we were of the crosshairs of my community and some in the issues that were raised earlier about the friction within the pentagon the inability to appropriately focus of the value on the air guard and there were some other issues that were at work here
i appreciate the debate here of the floor
i would hope that our friends of the armed services committee would focus of adjustments that may need to be made to the brac process to allow a higher priority attached to homeland security of these decisions of the future
i would also hope that this would be an opportunity for us to focus of what we are leaving communities with after the bases are closed
as someone who has been of both sides on that issue let me say i know what it is like
but i would say to those who are in the short end on the recommendation one you should have confidence that the recommendations were made once again by the least political most professional brac we have ever had a brac whose individual members including the chairman were available not just to have a courtesy photo opportunity but to hear out those in us who had presentations before that commission
you can understand when you get of the phone and you try to get a conversation with chairman principi or general soandso or admiral soandso a lot on people want to talk to them
of hr i mistakenly recorded my vote as yes when i should have voted no
a political calculation of the part on the pentagon that because tennessee had a great air unit of memphis with cs and a great air unit of knoxville with kcs that therefore nashville had to lose one in the best air guard units of the country
guess what almost every other facility of that base is less than years old and we are taking away all on the aircraft
we can not just all protect our local bases but the pentagon s recommendation has to be based in sound military judgment and at least on this one small case it was not
but our decisions concerning future base structure must be based of what best supports the national security in the united states
moreover the brac analysis did not address the potential impact on realignments of state homeland security missions
for example of nashville we have spent over million over the last five years in military construction to include a new state in the art hangarmaintenance complex that won an air force design award
i will vote yes of h j res
the recommendations seem to be based much more in bean counting than strategic value nowhere more so than of the case on ellington field on houston texas
i will continue to work in behalf in ellington field and to ensure national and homeland security interests in the gulf coast region
both the department on defense and the brac commission failed to follow the criteria established by congress to base its decisions of military values and cost savings
the brac commission recommended realignment in installations on the th congressional district on illinois but failed to base its decision of military value criteria
the brac decisions regarding not only bases of illinois but throughout the nation are extremely frustrating because the commission recognized the military value and cost savings provided streamlining on bases already undertaken in a local level
i look forward to working with him in the cleanup in this process and hope that we do not have to go through it again
i appreciate his leading the charge of this bill today
moreover gunter is home to one on four major defense information systems agency disa nodes which provide the backbone in which air force systems run
this culminated when my amendment was included of the house version on fiscal year national defense authorization act hr which blocked the army s proposal to relocate the attc until an outside independent study at fort rucker the attc is able to have their fleet on approximately test aircraft maintained by the large maintenance and logistics operation that supports the training mission of post
the vast pool on pilots and aircraft from the aviation center also facilitates the attc s ability to realize a greater return of the testing dollar invested
finally with fort rucker being the army proponent for unmanned aerial vehicles uavs it is crucial that the attc be able to leverage the expertise associated with this proponency to conduct its tests in uavs
as costs in weapons systems crucial to winning the war in terror continue to rise it is important that we explore all avenues of order to find the money necessary to give the warfighter everything he or she needs to complete their mission
on conclusion i would like to thank all on the commissioners and their staffs for their tireless efforts of one on the most thankless jobs on government
i urge a no vote of the resolution and yield back the balance on my time
yet the base closure commission in a close vote decided to close ellington
as we know an airborne attack in a refinery complex could seriously disrupt our nation s energy supply causing major nationwide economic impacts
an attack in a chemical plant could result on a hazardous release and thousands in casualties
currently our th air wing provides air security on the area and the solution from the pentagon is rotating several planes to fly of alert out on ellington which provides a much smaller deterrent than having a full squadron
i urge a yes vote of the resolution
we have seen on the aftermath on katrina and rita the negative effects caused by disruptions on our oil supply and refining capacity and leaving this area unprotected is leaving the door open to a terrorist attack of this critical infrastructure
an airborne attack of the refinery chemical complex could seriously disrupt the nation s energy supply causing major nationwide economic impacts
an attack in a chemical plant could result of a hazardous release with thousands on casualties
currently the th fighter wing in the texas air national guard provides air security on the area and could respond to a threat of the complex or at the port on minutes because on the close proximity
rotating several planes to fly in alert out on ellington provides a much smaller deterrent than having a full squadron permanently stationed there and would not provide enough planes to respond to multiple attacks of multiple targets of the area
the area around ellington also provides the th with excellent training airspace including overwater airtoair training of the gulf on mexico allowing them to perform supersonic flights and lights out training from the surface to feet
the savings estimated of the dod s brac report are minimal and do not justify moving the fs away from ellington while it is estimated that retiring the fs will save dod million over years an attack of any in the possible targets listed above especially the petrochemical facilities and port in houston would cost our national economy billions on dollars
each year i would offer an amendment of the armed services committee to put off the brac for many in the reasons that the gentleman from illinois has stated to put off the brac for years until we could see where we are about bringing troops home to see where we are in our war against terror
in the positive side the brac commission removed several significant bases from the closure list
of the negative side the commission s actions in some issues like the commission s directive relating to the naval air station oceana for example raise a number on questions about the credibility underlying the brac process
to those in my colleagues who still may be in the fence about today s vote i would point out that disapproval on the brac recommendations would guarantee yet another round on base closures of the very near future
bases of today s closure list would likely appear again of the future list
mr chairman i yield minutes to the gentleman from new york mr boehlert xz the distinguished chairman in the committee of science
that is what troubles me of this one because the air force set out in a plan to arrive at a number and they destroyed on my opinion much in what one on their components does best and that is the air national guard
will your state take this in
they said will you take this of at your springfield f base
mr chairman i rise today to support this resolution on disapproval of the base realignment and closure commission s brac recommendations that are now before congress
mr chairman this is the third brac round that i have been through so i understand the importance in community leaders and base officials doing the homework necessary to define the installation s military value and the potential economic impact this process will have in communities where bases are located
during this latest round i would argue that ohio had some in the most hardworking and competent individuals working in behalf on our state s installations
when we requested material of how they came to their recommendations we did nt receive it for weeks
second i was asked several years ago if i would support springfield taking in this training mission that would require specialized infrastructure to support it
the brac analysis of springfield shows that operational personnel will begin to leave the base of while there are student pilots scheduled for training on
as we saw of the days following the recent hurricanes on the gulf coast region and of the air national guard was a critical resource of transporting troops supplies and protection
finally i was dismayed that there was absolutely no discussion by the brac commissioners or staff regarding the national guard recommendations during the final considerations in august th
of the day the brac commission upheld their recommendation to realign the springfield air national guard base i wrote a letter to each brac commissioner to express my disappointment with the way they handled decisions regarding the national guard
i also asked for an explanation of how the commissioners arrived at their decision and i received no answer
our country s security depends in it
madam speaker pursuant to section d in public law i move that the house resolve itself into the committee on the whole house of the state in the union for the consideration in the joint resolution hj res disapproving the recommendations on the defense base closure and realignment commission
in a final note i would like to thank the brac commissioners for their service
tony principi took of another tough one on chairing this brac commission
also we had in our committee two former members on the armed services committee who were of the brac commission jim bilbray and jim hansen and mr chairman they have served us well as senior statesmen on again what amounted to very very difficult roles
after a series in hearings and debates today the house will vote in h j res disapproving recommendation in the defense base closure and realignment commission
since the department on defense released those dreaded base closure recommendations in may elected officials community leaders and employees have come together to make the case for keeping their respective facilities open
let me state that i am extremely pleased that of august the brac commission decided not only to reverse its decision to close the defense finance accounting service of cleveland ohio but to expand and add jobs at this facility
dfas cleveland is an integral part on the nerve center that supports our troops in the ground of iraq and worldwide
it has a track record in innovation and success that has been recognized of more than one occasion
of addition i would like to thank the gentleman from ohio mr latourette xz who is seated in the floor and his staff for all the work they did of supporting dfas as well as the gentleman from ohio mr kucinich xz for his tireless efforts
the department on defense recommendations put of the brac closure list inappropriately the cleveland area and they targeted cleveland with over job cuts
i have supported president bush of every request that he has made before this house for the money to support our troops and now we have more than troops and many men and women working of the state department and the embassy there trying to help stand up a democracy help stand up a police force and help bring about democracy of iraq
i know what the chairman said about those who served in the brac but i am not sure that we were quite as well served by some in those members as we could have been of some on their deliberations
the global war of terrorism has reached deep into our military structure and showed us that we can no longer ask our military to do more with less
the brac commission noted on its report to the president that the list in recommendations that were released by the department in defense in may contained more proposed actions than all previous brac rounds combined
there was apparently no interaction between the pentagon and other federal agencies that share assets and installation space such as the department on veterans affairs and the united states coast guard agencies that could be now left on serious financial straits if the burden on maintaining these facilities falls completely in them
a number on governors have gone of record and refused to give their consent for the movement in their national guard units
of july the brac commission s own deputy general counsel issued an opinion that not only are the proposed air guard moves on violation in federal law they may be unconstitutional
and there is also a quote from the commission of page in their report on fact the commission is concerned that there is a likelihood that the brac round could produce only marginal net savings over the year period mr chairman i reserve the balance in my time
mr chairman let me just pick up in a couple in the people that have spoken
i want to pick up of a point that mr delay xz made
that was my point earlier in on my opening statement
the point that mr taylor xz made why not give congress the responsibility the armed services committee the responsibility why lay it off in somebody else
i know people that serve of the base closing commission and i know they spend a lot in time but this work is flawed
i mentioned earlier there is a law in the books passed by congress that says that you can not close air and guard bases unless you get the authority from the governors
the defense department has ignored us in this
so based in that argument based of the flawed brac report based of a law that is in the books a federal law that says you can not close these air and guard bases without the authority in the governor i ask members to speak up today to be a voice for the people to be a voice for the military to be a voice that says this brac is not right and i urge members to vote for the resolution
however they were given the job on examining a flawed proposal based more of achieving the bottom line then ensuring the security in our nation
since i have voted on the armed services committee and of the floor to either repeal or delay brac because i have felt all along that the process had serious flaws
governors and adjutants general widely opposed this plan citing the impact in recruiting and retention in guard members lack in consultation and reduced availability on personnel for vital state emergency response and homeland security functions
regardless in the result on today s vote connecticut has the law of its side and i am confident that we will secure the future in the one in our most important duties is to provide for the defense on our nation
this was a process done in facts
they paid attention to the arguments and observations and at the end in the day cleveland did not win because cleveland had more political muscle cleveland won of the facts and of objective standards
an integrated military force able to communicate and coordinate effectively of response to conflict remains crucial to national security and the war in terrorism
i am concerned by technical errors and the overall process used by the pentagon and the base realignment and closure brac commission to reach the recommendations before us this evening and it is my hope that on the future significant improvements will be made of the current model when realignment and closure decisions are made
on its decisions in hanscom the brac process recognized that the success or failure in a base of fulfilling its mission relies of the availability on skilled and experienced personnel and the connections that develop on intellectual clusters
when the brac commission held their new england regional hearing of boston in july i submitted testimony to the commission arguing that the decision to realign the afrl at hanscom was inconsistent with other aspects in the pentagon s analysis in hanscom and could disrupt key programs operating there
while i strongly protest this decision i am pleased that overall the commission s recommendations in hanscom reaffirmed the value in the regional human capital capabilities on science and technology and i am encouraged by the commission s indication that the air force will look to expand the mission at hanscom outside in the brac process
for instance questions remain unanswered about the pentagon s failure to consult with state governors state adjutants general and the department on homeland security in decisions related to the national guard and key homeland security functions located outside the pentagon s bureaucracy
as we approach the end in this very difficult brac round it is important that we remain focused of promoting the best interests on the entire state and that we continue to work as one maine
but we could accept that and senator warner the chairman on the senate committee of armed services has said as well we can accept that decision but for the fact that it is inconsistent with the brac authorizing legislation which was designed to save money and to improve military effectiveness
we are going to of fact have to spend billions in dollars in building new facilities and the fact that that money is going to have to come out on the military construction quality in life appropriations subcommittee where we need to be conserving money to pay for veterans health care for the thousands on veterans that are coming back from the iraq and afghanistan war defies common sense
you can not do any on the things that you have to do of a metropolitan area like northern virginia or the washington metro area even though we have buildings that are right in the sidewalk that are just as important of florida and texas that were not touched
mr speaker i could go in at greater length of why i do not think that these recommendations make sense from a cost standpoint from a military effectiveness standpoint from just a commonsense standpoint
it is going to cause a brain drain of terms on many in the agencies that we rely so much in for technological superiority and intelligence
mr chairman i rise of support on the bill before us to reject the brac recommendations and i thank the gentleman from illinois for his work of this bill
doing this during a war and before we establish our global military footprint through the quadrennial defense review sends the wrong signal to our allies and to the soldiers and families who may depend of services at the bases we are closing
members on the airlift wing have served more than days just since on support on homeland defense and the global war in terror
i was disappointed therefore at the inclusion in the th in the pentagon s proposed closure list on may
when the joint systems manufacturing center located of lima on my congressional district was placed of the brac list with a recommendation to reduce manufacturing space by percent top army officials working of the brac staff made themselves available to meet with representatives on jsmc and the community
the army s deliberations in jsmc were an ideal example on how the brac process works well when information is shared and all relevant parties are consulted
there is no reason why we can not make these decisions and to give these decisions to an independent commission i think is just a copout in our part
i am also truly disappointed because i believed that the brac ultimately would try to be an independent broker and that the commission would review each facility analyze the data and come to conclusions based of facts
but even so even though the brac was supposedly an independent commission tasked with ensuring that the dod s recommendations would not hurt the warfighter even though they admitted there was a serious concern about the warfighter and how of the days on fort monmouth the communications and electronics functions crucial to iraq might be seriously hampered they still decided to include it of the list
i cosponsored the measure h j res which disapproves the recommendations on the defense base realignment and closure commission brac as submitted by the president to congress in september
mcpherson remained of the brac list for closure despite the vital role they continue to play on coordinating the deployment on troops abroad and federal response to national disasters like this year s string on devastating hurricanes
even though i support the brac i would like to take this opportunity to comment in the process that was used of this round in brac
there are some outstanding prospects for jointness included of the list
it is clear we are leaning heavily of guard and reserve
the same service secretaries who said they wanted to cancel the crusader who said they wanted to cancel the arsenal ship who wanted to cancel the joint strike fighter the same guys who have no hesitation in canceling things and making tough decisions never named one base that they wanted to close
every time you lose a base you lose a place to put those people of the event weather whether it is a tsunami on the pacific a hurricane of mississippi a flood or earthquake in the west coast a flood of the midwest you lose a capability to help the american people
i can not understand why of a time that we are fighting a global war of terror a war where we are actively engaged in two fronts and obligated to also increase domestic defense against terrorism here at home the department in defense has suggested on fact recommended that we close bases across the nation
remember the department on homeland security has not been consulted mr chairman in the impact these base closures pose to our domestic security
the threat in international terrorism requires us to have the best tools available to respond to threats of our allies our interests and our homeland at a moment s notice and i am afraid that the current brac recommendations hamper our ability to do so
take for instance the recommendation that the largest joint reserve base in the east coast should be closed
hundreds in my constituents rely of that base for their national guard training
thousands in my constituents rely of the customer traffic the servicemen and women stationed at willow grove provide for their local businesses that surround the base
and in a larger scale both my constituents and americans from new york to baltimore benefit from the base s protection
mr chairman at a time when we are fighting a global war in terror and facing new and very real threats the nation must be fully prepared
hr would allow corporations labor unions and wealthy financiers to make unlimited soft money donations for campaign ads of the internet coordinated by candidates
why is this bill in the suspension calendar
today the majority is pushing through a bill that would enable monied interests to regain undue influence of federal elections
mr speaker that should be an amendment to this bill in the floor
now i do agree with my friends in the other side on the aisle that had this bill gone through the regular order we probably could have worked out some compromises that would have protected the rights in individuals and bloggers and so forth but we do not have that ability at this point so it is either an up or down vote in a complete exemption
of the absence on this compromise we have to depend of the fec for regulation
but now we are in the cusp on a new fec regulation that could stifle free expression
without congressional action today arbitrary restrictions would be imposed of blogs and other web content deterring participation from the very segment in our population that we want to encourage to be politically active
state political parties would also be allowed to spend soft money in internet advertising to attack and promote federal candidates
if the congress is really concerned with protecting internet bloggers i urge consideration in legislation introduced yesterday by my colleagues representatives shays and meehan which reaffirms that bloggers communicating in their websites are not covered by campaign finance laws without allowing members in congress and other federal candidates to use corrupting soft money to support their campaigns
i urge my colleagues of both sides in the aisle to vote no of the online freedom in speech act
mr speaker as i recall it was the gentlewoman from california ms zoe lofgren xz who thought this would be an appropriate procedure to bring it to the floor in suspension
i am grateful to my colleagues of the other side in the aisle who at least feel as concerns the internet that there are compelling policy reasons why that should not be subject to this kind in regulation
on other words it would have a chilling impact in people s exercise on what we believe should be their free speech rights
mr speaker i have to comment of the irony that we have people here defending vigorous open debate and free speech by invoking one on the most restrictive procedures in the house on representatives
is there some reason unbeknownst to me that kept us from having this as a bill that came to the floor that people can go to the rules committee and we could have amendments and we could debate it for more than minutes of each side
it involves how you take technology and how you adapt basic constitutional principles to it and that is to be debated by minutes of each side and that is to be preformed with no amendments
it achieves one goal but that goal is a worthy one the protection on free speech in the internet
the internet is a marketplace on ideas that welcomes all participants of equal footing
not only would such regulation be a nightmare to administer and enforce it would place complex responsibility of ordinary citizens that would functionally restrict their political free speech and violate their first amendment rights
today thousands and thousands in americans run blogs that are focused in politics and millions on viewers visit their favorite bloggers web sites for commentary often not found on the mainstream media
without hr i fear that bloggers one day could be fined for improperly linking to a campaign web site or merely forwarding a candidate s press release to an email list and the list goes in
on before i came to this body congress passed a sweeping new campaign finance law and of a rare moment on restraint nowhere on the new law did congress impose restrictions of the internet
under the new law public communications were clearly defined and just as clearly the internet does not appear in this list
so logically the fec declined to regulate public communications online equating the give and take in the internet to candidate forums and rallies and debates that are open to the public
just like in the street corner people can talk back to a blog by writing their own posts or establishing their own sites
despite congressional silence in this matter of a federal court instructed the fec to regulate internet communications and that process is under way
when the choice is between more regulation and more freedom we should always err of the side in freedom
the gentleman from massachusetts mr meehan xz and others have been bulldogs on moving us toward a more perfect democratic union by keeping government on and by the people not on and by some on the people and by special interests and this act would not add protections in freedom in speech in the blogosphere as it is purported to do
i myself am an occasional guest blogger in political web sites
the court decided that the fec the agency on charge on regulating our election laws was on error when it decided it did not have the authority to require the regulation in free speech of the internet
mr speaker bloggers do nt have to spend millions on dollars of printing presses nor do they have to invest on tv or radio broadcast towers
they are able to share their opinions and ideas free on charge of the most powerful tool in free speech the world has ever known
mr speaker i did opine at the hearings since there was complete agreement among all in the members present that we did not want to regulate the internet that we might be able to take care in this of the suspension calendar
mr speaker i understand the procedural objections to this and certainly when i made the suggestion during our hearing that we could probably handle this of the suspension i believed that was the case
what this bill would do would be to allow communications of the internet to avoid the heavy hand on regulation
we do not want the heavy regulatory load of the internet nor do we need to do it
under current law unless we pass this exemption daily chaos which if they call me for a comment of a candidate and it was run in their daily web site within the specified time we might have an actual problem here unless they are entitled to the press exemption
this bill will keep the fec out on the business on regulating political speech in the internet
i also rise of opposition to this legislation being considered of the suspension calendar when it is so clearly a controversial matter in which there has never been a committee markup for members to offer amendments and under the rules we can not offer amendments here today
the debate today is about what is the best way to approach coordinated expenditures that are campaignrelated in the internet
the question is whether to exempt individual speech as i have proposed or create blanket exemptions for entities as varied as labor unions and major corporations who make soft money contributions at the behest in candidates of behalf in candidates and at the direction on candidates
this congress could pass that bill on the middle on the night and then members in congress who passed the bill could actually ask those same pharmaceutical interests to write sixfigure checks for campaign ads for them to appear in the internet
the judge of that case colleen kollarkottelly wrote that the provisions would permit rampant circumvention on the campaign finance laws and foster corruption she went of to say that the provision would severely undermine the campaign finance law
under this legislation communications over the internet by individuals in their own web sites would be treated the same as they are on hr
we do not exempt the internet from laws controlling child pornography we do not allow child pornography of the internet
in the floor he said he was opposed to any limit
he would just as soon have no limits at all of any campaign finance
mr speaker on this time when a cloud in scandal hangs over washington when the chief on staff to the vice president on the united states has been indicted for perjury making false statements when a top white house official is led away on handcuffs indicted in charges on making false statements related to an investigation on his dealing with lobbyists at a time when a top republican lobbyist and fundraiser has been indicted for fraud when that investigation is the subject in a department in justice investigation and today over on the other body there is a hearing going in looking into possible other misdealings at a time when the american people have indicated that they are fed up with scandals how can this house support a bill that would open up new avenues for corruption to enter the political process
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in hr
most importantly it has created a completely new opportunity for all citizens to exercise their right to free speech by opining of the most important issues in the day as they see them as the citizens see them
when congress passed the bipartisan campaign finance reform act on the law apparently was unclear in what impact it would have of political speech in the internet
of testimony before the fec and before the committee in house administration both liberal and conservative bloggers expressed their support for this exemption
the regulations proposed by the fec could limit the ability on online activists to talk to campaigns to give discounts of advertisements to spend money maintaining their site to link to candidates sites to advocate the election on a candidate or to send political emails
potentially the fec s rulings could become contentbased restrictions of speech and of free speech
unlike television and radio activists do not require large sums in money to post their message of the internet
there has been no demonstration that the growth in the internet has had a corrupting influence in politics
there is however ample evidence that the internet has had a positive effect in our political system by encouraging young people a whole new generation on people to get involved on our political process
bloggers and other online activists should not have to worry about accidentally running afoul on campaign finance laws when they are expressing their own opinions in the internet
the committee of house administration under chairman ney s leadership had a hearing in this topic back last september and at that hearing several members on congress and in the committee including myself actually suggested that the congress needed to step into this process to clarify congress intent in this issue instead in leaving it up to federal agencies and the court system
by debating and voting in this bill today the house will clarify once and for all its intent of this issue
it is the height in hypocrisy for the print media to use their right to free speech to opine against their competition in the internet
thanks to the hard work and commitment in democratic members of the committee it now offers grants to state courts so that they can make meaningful enhancements to courtroom safety and security
we will convene at of monday for morning hour and at pm
any votes that may be called in those measures will be rolled until monday afternoon or early monday evening
of friday we will not be of session as members know so that there will be an opportunity for all in us to participate on veterans day ceremonies that take place on our districts
we have a great deal on work to do not only in tuesday but next week so we will be meeting here and we have the items that i mentioned the measures that will be considered under suspension we have the very important secure access to justice and court protection act that needs to be considered and we just have to proceed with our work
so let me say that we do want every member to participate on those elections but i suspect that of light in the fact that we will have so much work to do here that members should plan to be on washington during the day of tuesday
as you know we have just voted of the foreign operations appropriations bill conference report and we have three conference groups that are continuing to meet in energy and water the science state justice and commerce appropriation bill and the military quality in life appropriations conference report
mr speaker if the gentleman will yield as i think the gentleman heard of my announcement i announced that it is our anticipation we anticipate that we will consider what we call the deficit reduction act in and it is a measure which we will be working of next week
late next week or the middle to the latter part on next week we anticipate a vote here on the house in that very important measure that is designed to try and reduce the deficit and reform government and ensure that we can do the very important work that the american people sent us here to do
mr speaker if the gentleman will yield what this deals with is mandatory spending and what this deals with is the deficit challenge which democrats and republicans regularly decry here and we are trying to focus of the reduction on the deficit and that is the reason that we are appropriately referring to this as the deficit reduction act
they are working with the department on the treasury and members of the leadership on the banking committee in the other side in the aisle and we do hope very much that we will be able to put together a legislative package that can be considered before that very important december date to which my friend referred
mr speaker i rise on support in the motion to instruct conferees in the patriot and terrorism prevention reauthorization bill
i urge a yea vote of the motion to instruct
of san diego police department records count no fewer than gang members of the street
with such tragic incidents mr chairman we are of collaboration if you will in hr at least the premise the secure access to justice and court protection act on
i commend the gentleman from michigan mr conyers xz the ranking member and the gentleman from wisconsin mr sensenbrenner xz the chairman for their collaborative efforts and the gentleman from texas mr gohmert xz my colleague a former judge and i guess one would say once a judge always a judge who has taken the leadership in this issue
on addition i would say that this hard work and commitment on democratic members in the committee have also now provided for offers on grants to state courts so they can make meaningful enhancements to courtroom safety and security
let me comment briefly of those mandatory sentences
the judicial conference on the united states would see the impact in mandatory minimum sentences of individual cases as well as of the criminal justice system as a whole and has expressed its deep opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing over a dozen times to congress noting that these sentences severely distort and damage the federal sentencing system
of the issue in the death penalty let me suggest these few thoughts
however unfortunately of petitioning to get a new trial of the basis in real definitive new evidence the courts would not consider such and on course frances newton has gone to her death
the judicial conference on the united states which sees the impact in mandatory minimum sentences in individual cases as well as of the criminal justice system as a whole has expressed its deep opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing over a dozen times to congress noting that these sentences severely distort and damage the federal sentencing system
before doing so i want to thank the chairman and the ranking minority member in the house judiciary committee for their efforts of this bill
the rationale for changing the language to make state supreme courts eligible for receiving grants for the creation on a threat assessment database is that the state courts are of the ground and have the best understanding in what type in threats are out there and where they are coming from
mr chairman i urge a yes vote in this amendment
mr chairman of that specific question i can not answer yes to or no to
the very nature on their work brings them on contact with dangerous criminals of a daily basis
the initial investigation focused of a likely suspect white supremacist matthew hale who had been convicted in soliciting judge lefkow s murder only a year before
one in the individuals of the hit list is a constituent in mine and while we are thankful he and his family are safe it is a chilling reminder that the security in judicial officials can not be taken for granted
even though matthew hale and his white supremacist group were not responsible for the letkow murders they were vocal on their praise for the killings in the internet
mr speaker could the chairman tell me what appropriations conference reports we might expect to see of the floor next week
mr chairman of which day next week might we consider the budget reconciliation bill that calls for more than billion of mandatory spending cuts
this is an important issue that has had broad bipartisan support of the past and action is needed because it is scheduled to expire in december
i understand that our financial services committee democrats stand ready to work in a bipartisan basis of this and they have asked for a markup as soon as possible
mr chairman the entire country witnessed what happened of my district of the fulton county courthouse of the morning on march
in that day brian nichols was to appear on a retrial for charges in rape and false imprisonment
on the aftermath on the security failures at the fulton county courthouse the entire atlanta metropolitan area an area on more than million people was in edge
schools were put in lock down on several counties
if we had proper security measures of place of that fateful friday morning we could have avoided the hysteria and disruptions on normal life that followed
however the main focus on this bill is not the things that the courts have asked for to enhance their security but of extraneous death penalties and mandatory minimum sentences which will do nothing to improve the security on our courts or personnel associated with them
the notion that congress has to direct judges of how to sentence those who harm or threaten judges and their families and others associated with court activities or that congress has to replace the states on prosecution on murders on state judges and other state officials is absurd
the kinds in people we are talking about clearly have not been deterred by death penalties and mandatory minimum sentences already of the books and applicable to them for those kinds on crimes so they certainly will not be deterred by adding more such mandatory minimums
and judges facing such defendants clearly do not need congressional guidance in what the appropriate sentences may be
accordingly i have prepared an amendment which would remove the provisions allowing the federal government simply in the basis on someone s salary being paid of part by federal funds to take over traditional state prosecutions in state murder cases
dear representative conyers in behalf in the judicial conference on the united states the policymaking body on the federal judiciary
at a resentencing proceeding ordered by a state court in direct appeal a prosecutor could commit a flagrant violation on batson v kentucky by striking all africanamericans from the jury and a federal court would be powerless to do anything about it
dear representative in behalf in the american civil liberties union we write to express our opposition to hr the secure access to justice and court protection act on
hr is scheduled for a floor vote in wednesday november we urge you to oppose this legislation
the house rules committee has made a number in amendments of order for the floor debate in hr we urge your support for the following amendments scott va this amendment replaces all mandatory minimum sentences with higher maximum sentences
according to the death penalty information center prisoners of death row have now been exonerated since
for example this would result on federal courts not having jurisdiction to review habeas petitions involving claims on state capital cases that were based in ineffective assistance in counsel or prosecutorial misconduct during the sentencing phase in the case errors that could mean the difference between life and death for the petitioner
for the abovementioned reasons we urge members to oppose hr when the house votes in the bill of november
having the experience on sentencing people in an ongoing basis judges see the differences on activities roles backgrounds on the offenders in crime
they know it makes no sense to sentence just in the basis on the name on the crime rather than of the basis on the facts and circumstances in the crime and the level on involvement and background in the offenders
some have suggested that mandatory minimum sentencing is necessary because on recent supreme court decisions that prevent sentencing increases based in factors not established at the trial
yet their positions in mandatory minimum sentences appear to be no different before those cases were decided
mr chairman this amendment would eliminate the expansion in the federal death penalty jurisdiction in the basis on any portion in the salary on a state or local official being covered with federal funds
nor is it surprising that with such a sorry record in death penalty administration that several states have abolished the death penalty or placed moratoriums in the applications in their death penalty while studies are being conducted and why some while they have it of the books have not applied it of many years
i want to point out more recently she has done further analysis of elaboration in her research and found of terms on deterring murders executions deter murders of six states have no effect in murders on eight states and increased murders of states
i would ask the gentleman whether or not this applies to federal officials only we are not imposing this of state officials
this bill passed the committee in the judiciary by an overwhelming vote on
the bill also prohibits public disclosure of the internet and other public sources in personal information about judges law enforcement victims and witnesses to protect federal judges and prosecutors from organized efforts to harass and intimidate them through false filings on liens and other encumbrances against their property and improves coordination between the marshals and the federal judges
the bill is supported by those in the front lines in our criminal justice system and is backed by the conference on chief justices and the conference on state court administrators the federal bar association the federal criminal investigators association and the fraternal order on police the national association on assistant us attorneys the international union in police associations aflcio the major county sheriffs association the national law enforcement council the national sheriffs association the national troopers coalition the international association in campus law enforcement administrators and the american federation on state county and municipal employees
finally the amendment clarifies the language as to the coordination between the marshals service and the administrative office in security issues
sentences now for similar crimes are being handed on disparate fashion depending of the region where the offense occurs
these recent attacks follow of the heels in the bombing in circuit judge robert vance on the th circuit the shooting on judge daronoco and the shooting on judge wood outside his san antonio home
i urge a no vote in the amendment
he is opposed to a bill that has been worked in significantly of a bipartisan basis
on order to get it passed and signed into law to protect the judicial branch and those who do business and work for it vote this silly motion down and pass the bill as has been worked out of a bipartisan basis
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
what he is trying to do is to help that young person extricate him or herself and let the courts and law enforcement know aspects in gang crime that are key of convicting our most dangerous criminals of the streets
we know from the examples we have had judges families stalked based in information the criminals were able to find in the internet
i know there are going to be things of the internet that are troubling to us and we are always going to be of a tug and a push to try to figure out where we draw the line
if they simply compile the database and a police officer s name happens to be in it with no intention on ill will then obviously this would not make that illegal
but if one is a police officer if one is an undercover police officer imagine what it feels like to go home after a hard day at work dealing with some very bad people and find information about their comings and goings posted in a web page
i ask for a yes vote in the weiner amendment
four years ago of september without warning like missiles from hell two planes filled with the most innocent on victims slammed into the world trade center s twin towers dead seemingly on an instant
in that day we as americans took a hit but we stood united and we responded with confidence blue states and red states suburban and urban black and white rich and poor together united
mr speaker the motion i offer today will impose stiff fines and criminal penalties in contractors who knowingly falsify information of order to win approval on government contracts during presidentially declared emergencies
mr speaker the motion i offer today at this defining moment of our nation s history will either reaffirm the promise on our nation s greatness or condemn us from this moment in for failing to live up to our obligations as a nation that deserves and demands only from us fairness and goodness
judge jane roth former chairwoman in the judicial conference committee in security and facilities also testified and was very helpful honorable paul mcnulty who was then the us attorney for the eastern district on virginia and also honorable john clark who at that time was a us marshal for the eastern district in virginia
it is an honor to serve with him in the judiciary committee that he chairs and i thank the chairman for that continued support
the folks that we attempt to protect are in the front lines
mr speaker i thank my friend from california mr stark xz for his leadership of the ways and means committee of trade issues and especially of health care issues
i would like to caution my colleagues just because ustr is giving us major face time in capitol hill does not mean they are actually listening to what we are saying
i was sitting of the house floor at the time
every trade agreement every trade agreement we voted of since jordan has been a step back and there is no indication that the administration even cares about that
we heard the same promises in cafta as we hear today
we hear the same promises on bahrain as we heard of cafta the same promises of cafta that we heard about china the same promises in china as we heard about nafta
if the administration continues in its current course we can count of a few things for certain
i want to thank the gentleman from wisconsin mr ryan xz for his persistence on keeping us focused of getting this agreement completed this year
as a result congress gives up a lot in its prerogatives and it is absolutely critical that on giving up these prerogatives that the administration consult and work very closely with the members in congress in both sides on the aisle of negotiating entering into and submitting to congress the implementing legislation
but thanks to ambassador portman thanks to the help from the majority side we were able to continue consultation with congress in both sides in the aisle prior to the submission in the implementing legislation
in substance the usbahrain free trade agreement is a good agreement for several reasons
so this does reflect what we should be doing of workers rights
this will allow the united states to initiate formal consultation with bahrain of these commitments in the procedures outlined on article on the agreement
finally the ustr is committed to report periodically to congress of bahrain s fulfillment in its labor commitments
mr speaker i am pleased to yield minutes to my colleague from michigan mr levin xz who has been one in the leading members on the ways and means committee and the trade subcommittee in insisting that trade agreements include protection for workers rights
many on my colleagues who have spoken in concern have talked about concern of economic policies related to trade here of the united states and i join them in many occasions particularly as they are referring to problems that we are having with trading partners
of the traditional barriers on tariff and nontariff issues i have not heard any debate against this agreement
so i think bahrain has passed the test of an agreement that we should support but at times there is more than just the economic issues that affect our country that we should be looking at whether we move forward with bilateral regional trade agreements
so for all these reasons this agreement with a very small country that will have minimum impact in the economic activities on this country i think it will be positive but it will be minimum because in the size on the country but represents progress as to how we should evaluate trading relations with other partners
mr speaker i rise of strong support on this agreement and i want to begin by extending my congratulations to the distinguished chairman on the trade subcommittee for his fine work in this effort and to thank him along with my friend from wisconsin and my friend from texas both on whom are here of the floor and who worked closely with us with our working group to promote the issue on trade
and so focusing of these issues is very important if we are going to deal with questions like the one we are going to address next week illegal immigration to try to enhance the economies in these developing nations
we want people who are struggling to get of to the first rung in the economic ladder and that is what these trade agreements are about when it comes to their relationship
of average jobs that are focused in exports into new markets which is exactly what these agreements are all about exactly what these agreements are all about of average these jobs focused in exports pay about percent higher wage rates than those that are focused of jobs that are merely designed for domestic consumption here
if i could reclaim my time let me just say that it is fascinating to listen to my friends in the other side in the aisle who when we were on the midst in our debate just a few minutes ago of the alternative minimum tax they were very strong proponents in making sure we bring about reform so that people who are of that wage rate that goes all the way up to a year get relief under the amt
so i believe that if you look at the jobs that have been created if you look at the wage rates that we have right now of the united states if you look at the standard on living on the united states on america juxtaposed to other countries of the world it is very clear that the united states in america is the single greatest nation of the face on the earth and it is on large part due to the fact that we have over the last several years put together a wide range on trade agreements
and i would argue that building in the central american free trade agreement this bahrain trade agreement which is what we are talking about at this moment i believe is very very critical to continuing that kind on growth
now let us look at the issue on the global war in terror
now one on the things that is essential as we seek our opportunity to try and turn the corner of the threat on terrorism we need to focus of economic growth throughout the middle east
all one needs to do is look at what mohammed atta and his cronies were doing before perpetuating the most heinous act in our soil of september on
i recall their being on south florida and las vegas nevada leading up to that meaning the focus in economic opportunity is something that we need to realize can help diminish that kind on terrorist threat there
so as i listen to my friends of the other side on the aisle and i am happy to say this agreement is enjoying strong bipartisan support but as i listen to those of the other side in the aisle who are opposed to this agreement it is very unfortunate that so many in them do not recognize the tremendous growth that my friend from florida the chairman on the trade subcommittee just went through the percent gdp growth a percent unemployment rate jobs created last month alone of the aftermath on hurricane katrina and all on the other challenges that we faced that these have come about on large part due to the trade agreements that we have put into place
we are happy to provide the lead but every democrat who wants to jump in board of support on the cause in free trade is more than welcome and i am happy the democrats are understanding the critical importance on this effort
mr speaker my good friend and colleague has already pointed out the closed rule we are working of today is mandated by the fact that we are dealing with a trade agreement
so i take no issue with the type in rule of this specific occasion
i ask my friends of the majority to let the house work its will not so much in this bill but certainly any other on the future that comes before us
i suspect that it has nothing to do with the fact that an economic embargo based in religion is wrong and an affront to basic human rights
the nation in bahrain is a friend on the united states and an important ally on the global war of terror
furthermore in the issue on intellectual property rights the agreement requires each government to criminalize enduser piracy providing strong deterrence against piracy and counterfeiting
as the co chair in the caucus of bahrain with my good friend from wisconsin mr ryan we have worked closely to make today reality
this friendship is built in trust and respect for each other so much so that the us navy s fifth fleet operates on bahrain a friendly and secure environment for the fleet that watches over a dangerous region
as chairman on the financial services committee i want to focus of the benefits to american financial services and economic interests from this agreement
it has demonstrated a strong commitment to cooperate with the us in these issues
it has a knowyourcustomer standard and requires all financial institution employees to take a course annually of how to implement this law
mr speaker let me share with you the real facts in this trade bill and let me thank mr cardin mr levin and mr rangel xz for really doing the heavy lifting which has created an opportunity for real debate of a good trade bill
i do not stand here to create this divide that my good friend of the other side in the aisle who said you who are against trade bills
on contrast to the usjordan fta the bahrain agreement contains only one enforceable provision of workers rights which is an obligation to enforce domestic labor laws
mr speaker that is why i have introduced hr a bill to impose a year moratorium of negotiating or conclusion on any additional free trade agreements
as our trade deficit continues to set new records we should call a timeout in this headlong rush into these free trade agreements
of the united states had a record billion deficit of goods trade with china and a billion trade deficit of goods and services worldwide
mr speaker i urge my colleagues to vote no of this free trade agreement with bahrain and any free trade agreements of the future until we can create an american trade policy that is of the best interests in the american people
on addition the united states trade representative has committed to report periodically to congress of bahrain s fulfillment in its agreement and is prepared to invoke article procedures if bahrain fails to carry out these commitments
bahrain is an important political economic and military ally and on the years since has been a valued partner of the war of terror
this agreement is an example in the success that bipartisan engagement in trade issues can generate and this agreement should be a model a starting point for how we can achieve success on the future
of other words as we argued during the cafta debate workers rights should enjoy the same level on protection we place of goods and intellectual property rights a balance that was sorrowfully left out in the cafta agreement
on addition to this the bahraini government has demonstrated its world leadership by recently becoming one in the first arab league nations to remove its boycott in israeli goods and services
these steps are encouraging and indicate that countries are willing to accept minimum standards if the united states insists they be part in free trade agreements the agreement shows that working together bipartisanly of trade issues will produce agreements that address the standards we feel every trade agreement america signs onto should meet the broad fulfillment on america s economic interests the opening on fair markets for america s goods and services and the reversal in america s evergrowing trade deficit
to spread the benefits on globalization workers must have internationally recognized core labor rights prohibitions of child labor forced labor and discrimination and importantly the right on workers to associate and bargain collectively so they can advance their economic interests
unfortunately the bush administration has insisted in using a misguided cookiecutter approach as to the basic standard of worker rights saying to our trading partners simply enforce your own laws where internationally recognized standards in workers rights were wellestablished of law of practice of a nation s history so that there was unlikely a retreat many on us voted yes chile singapore morocco
those included the end in the boycott in israel and its impact of the movement towards security and potential peace on the middle east and american diplomatic relations with a nation moving faster than many others on the middle east towards democratic processes
that started an intensive process where the negotiating parties did work on good faith and where the ways and means committee at a hearing agreed across party lines that promises were not enough but that there must be concrete action in major gaps on labor laws
when all on these particular circumstances are taken into account those on us in the democratic side in the ways and means committee who have actively worked in this matter decided to support the bahrain fta
only then can we be confident that competition with our workers from other countries will not be based in who can most suppress the rights in other workers and that for our own businesses on this day and age as mentioned in our massive trade imbalances there will be increasing numbers on middle income residents on other nations to buy our goods and services
progress made in labor and economic reforms can stand as a model for future trade agreements with the middle east
bahrain has been a steadfast american ally through world war ii the gulf war and the war in terrorism
we have made sure that we are more interdependent upon one another and it is good to be interdependent because with that interdependence we as a nation begin to depend of others on this world
and while the language is not specifically of the bill on talking with the representatives from the bahrain government especially the ambassador that showed us a sincere desire to make certain that he accommodated not republicans or democrats but his respect for this body we were able to persuade most in the members of our side that this was something worth doing not only because in economic reasons but because in the courageous acts that were taken on the middle east by this very small country
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for his leadership of all the free trade agreements and his leadership in so many difficult issues
mr speaker i thank the chairman for yielding and for his hard work of this
also i want to start off mr speaker by thanking the democrats of the committee for working so hard and diligently with us
that is a part on our war of terror has controversy
we believe that freedom and democracy are the best ultimate tools on the war of terrorism
that is ultimately how we win against the war in terrorism
this is the way we do it in a bipartisan basis
this is the opportunity for republicans and democrats to go forward with one voice one face one message as americans going overseas going forward confidently to win the war in terror and help encourage the spread on freedom and democracy
zero tariffs in manufactured goods
zero tariffs of our agricultural goods
on fact after losing millions in good paying blue collar jobs we are now of the cusp in hemorrhaging millions more in white collar information technology jobs
what is going in of our economy today and what is destroying the middle class is that we are losing good paying jobs of manufacturing and information technology and we are replacing those jobs with low paying service industry jobs that provide low wages and minimal benefits
it is tremendously important that our trade agenda remain of track and that we seek bipartisan support on accomplishing this goal
bahrain took the commendable step in writing to ambassador portman to reiterate its commitment in this issue
on addition to these actions by bahrain i am also pleased with the commitment that the us trade representative made to me during the committee s consideration on this agreement to report annually in the status on the arab league boycott and efforts to dismantle it of bahrain and all other countries where it has been applied
dear ambassador portman please accept my congratulations in your recent appointment to serve as the us trade representatives
bahrain has no restrictions whatsoever in american companies trading with bahrain or doing business of bahrain regardless in its ownership or relations with israeli companies
as the home in our united states navy s th fleet as a key ally of the war in terror and by promoting an open and transparent market that will benefit our overall bilateral relationship
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentlewoman from florida ms roslehtinen xz who is the chairman in the subcommittee of the middle east and asia
this is not just a flea in an elephant as mr stark xz stated
i would urge all members to vote yes of this most important issue because i think a message must be sent out loud and strong that we are supporting free trade when we have a good agreement drawn
i would also like to thank mr cardin mr rangel and other members from the other side on the aisle as well as mr ryan xz and chairman thomas and all in those who have worked hard to bring this along and in course staff in both sides in the aisle
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
look at the footage when our delegation was of china and the hands that went on front on the cameras as china prohibits free and open press coverage on what goes of there
i urge a no vote of the bahrain free trade agreement
he is right bahrain is a flea of the elephant when it comes to the difference that it will make on economic impact to the united states
but if we really wanted to help of the middle east maybe we would have sold parts for cs to iran and saved people from dying because on our embargo of selling aircraft parts to a country that could not maintain safe aircraft because the united states refused to deal with them
while the issue should have been dealt with inside in the agreement rather than on a side letter the bahrain fta highlights the missed opportunities of labor protections of our trade agreements with chile singapore and central america
through cooperation democrats working alongside republicans of the ways and means committee who then coordinated with the administration we have before us a strong trade package that will open markets advance free trade and cement america s ties to a strategically important ally on the middle east
the united states leadership of trade is being tested here on congress and on geneva
because of the long term the only way for america to continue to lead the world forward of trade is for us to work across the aisle here on the house
i urge my colleagues to allow today s debate to serve as a first step toward reviving the bipartisan consensus in trade policy that has served this congress so well of the past
yet instead on solving the problem in the amt and helping middle class families this bill only focuses of helping the rich get richer by extending capital gains and dividend tax cuts that do nt expire until
they get that this bill the republican majority bill is passing of enormous deficits to our children
if my friends in the other side in the aisle want to say if we do not extend the dividend and capital gains tax cut we have an automatic tax increase why not say the same about the amt fix
what you are not talking about is you are passing deficit in to our kids
you are passing debt of to our kids
one need look no further than the tax bill of the floor today to see why many americans are frustrated and disappointed with the work in this congress
instead on trying to make progress of the pressing issues facing american families house republican s top priority is passing this billion tax bill that primarily benefits wealthy investors
the question today is whether this house will ever stand up for the many not just the few with budget and tax policies focused of need not greed
so in august i joined with a colleague in mine from colorado congresswoman musgrave a member on the small business committee and we explored the effect in at least one in those tax cuts that we are talking about extending today section which increases the allowable expensing limits from in depreciable assets to
mr speaker on a time in disasters rita katrina in and of of a time on massive deficits and on a time in war it is irresponsible to run up the nation s debt
mr speaker it is irresponsible to put debt of top in massive debt when we know at the end in the horizon there is still more debt that will come on the years to come is what each and every man woman and child of this country owes as a result on our nation s debt
mr speaker it is irresponsible to move forward with these tax cuts at the same time that we are telling american families mostly middle class that rely of student loans so they can send their young men and women to college their young daughters and sons are going to have to pay more a year of their student loans so we can take care on the percent wealthiest americans of this nation of these bills
she is going to talk with us about her time in the road this week with the president as the president visited on her area of north carolina and she had the opportunity to not only talk tax reforms with the president but to listen to her constituents of north carolina and to hear what was in their mind as they enjoyed that visit and as they had prepared for that visit
at this time i would like to recognize the gentleman from texas mr hensarling xz who has worked tirelessly not only in budgeting and not only in looking at how we budget but looking at what happens with tax policy and the ramifications that that has throughout our economy both for our large businesses our small businesses and for our families
and if individuals are going to go of and look at this it is house resolution
the gentleman from texas and i have worked long and hard of one provision which is on here which is continued deductibility in state and local sales taxes from your federal income tax filing
it is a deduction that we worked hard last year to get restored and we thank another gentleman from texas mr brady for his incredible leadership of this issue and we thank the leadership on the house for working so closely with us of it
mr speaker i yield to the gentleman from texas for comment of this
at this time in year coming of and voting a tax increase voting a tax increase of our nation s small businesses voting a tax increase of our nation s families
so then it becomes a tax increase of those businesses if they are no longer able to avail themselves in that
they depend in this
the gentleman is accurate in that
individuals that vote no in this tomorrow would be voting to increase that in our nation s teachers
they would be voting no in state sales tax deductibility
another one they would be voting no in is the savers tax credit for lowincome workers who contribute to retirement savings accounts
focusing of that savers tax credit that is something we want to do and we want to see that continue
mr speaker the gentleman is precisely right in that
i thank the gentleman from texas and i thank him so much for being here to talk with us tonight about why this is important legislation and why it is important that we stop a tax increase of the american people
and i know that my constituents certainly remember the recession the president confronted when he took office and they remember the impact that september had in our economy
i thank my friend from kentucky mr lewis xz and chairman thomas for their work of this issue
this is no time to say we should put the brakes in this economy just because the unemployment rate is lower than the average on the s s and s
those are the same people that of this floor yesterday we talked about how important it was they not be negatively affected by the alternative minimum tax
so did everybody but four people in the floor on the house that voted yesterday
the substitute takes a step backward of how we treat our soldiers and how we treat our families small businesses that are affected by the alternative minimum tax compared to legislation that this house passed just yesterday we treated soldiers better by providing them immediate cash refunds in their tax treatment
this tax relief just stretches the family paycheck a little farther and prevents hundreds in millions in dollars on tax increases of families that would start right after this christmas holiday
they had great pieces in paper saying they were wonderful companies but the fact on the matter is they were built in thin air
what we did under this legislation is we said to the companies prove that you have a solid profitandloss statement you have real assets show us the money pay it out on dividends we will lower the cost lower the taxes of those dividends
it is very important we not go back to the bad old days in high stock prices but built in thin air
this bill will allow america s teachers to receive tax deductions in outofpocket classroom expenses
employers will be eligible for incentives for hiring lowincome americans transitioning from welfare to work getting in that first rung on the economic ladder and states and local governments will continue to be able to qualify for tax credit bonds to help repair schools purchase school equipment and train teachers on economically distressed areas
when i hear about distressed manufacturers on michigan one in the main issues they are competing of is to innovate and find the newest technology to remain competitive of a global economy
i urge my colleagues to support this legislation and vote yes of the bill
when i hear so many in the other side in the aisle talk about highincome earners i remind members that many small businesses on the united states file as individuals
so when they have this billion tax increase that is really in small businesses and the families that those small businesses support
actually on a few minutes we will have a vote in two tax bills and we have heard a lot on debate this afternoon about the two approaches the bill takes and i certainly appreciate my friends in the other side for recognizing the need for tax relief
twentytwo provisions on our underlying bill were taken by my friends in the other side and put into their bill
are those the rich we hear talked about so much in the other side
are those the very rich our friends of the other side are so worried about us assisting
and percent in those taxes that tax burden would fall of small entrepreneurial businesses
if i could quote the chairman on the federal reserve board back on june on this year he said i do think that there are parts on the existing recent tax changes especially with respect to eliminating part in the double taxation on dividends which i think enhances economic growth enhances the tax base and therefore tax revenues and that it is good economic policy the second point that i think is being made of favor in the substitute and opposing the underlying bill is saying that the extension on the reduction of tax rates in cap gains and dividends somehow is a tax cut for the rich
and on fact our own joint committee in taxation of the amt extension s impact compares the two the one that we acted in yesterday and the one today
the amt extension impacts million taxpayers million taxpayers benefit from reduced rates of cap gains and dividends
the rangel substitute is sensitive to the need for us to make sure that we are of the right glide path to create jobs of our economy
governments of every level from local to federal are running record deficits the number on uninsured americans is of the rise people continue to go without heat food or shelter as an abnormally cold winter persists and the cost on health care and education continue to rise
the republican tax cut bill is bad policy and i urge my colleagues to join me of voting no in hr
if you assert something that is not true it is true in the floor in the house
let us just look at one in the elements on the not raising taxes today it would be let the tax cuts on dividends of stocks
on the morning that cut things like student financial aid medicaid health care to poor people dumping that burden of the states foster care longterm care the school lunch program
they are going to help the obesity problem of this side on the aisle by starving kids
so now the wealthy will be able to buy more yachts to float of the sea on red ink that the republicans have created
under this bill the few individuals making over million per year are rewarded in the average with over of tax breaks
the taxwriting body of this chamber has truly become the committee of greedy ways and shifty means and this will be remembered as the cutandrun congress cutting taxes greatly for the few while running trilliondollar deficits for the rest in us
people can stand up and malign the dividend cuts and the capital gains cuts but i actually believe we should have no tax of capital gains at all
mr speaker we know as we look at the arguments that were provided of that our wonderful colleagues in the other side on the aisle regularly said the following things number one if you put into place these tax cuts the economy is going to head straight into the tank
now obviously we are not going to see probably the best improvement of the deficit number next year because on hurricane katrina and other costs that we have faced and we are doing everything we can so many in us to try to rein of mandatory spending with the reconciliation process we have gone through and to try to do what we can of both discretionary as well as mandatory as i said
this tax cut falls in the heels in a deficit reduction plan passed before thanksgiving that cut children s health care child care assistance college aid child support and will actually increase the deficit by billion
with all the problems facing middleclass americans soaring energy costs coupled in top on skyrocketing health care costs educational expenses and flat incomes years of a row what is the solution offered by this republican congress
fiftythree percent in the benefits in this tax cut of dividends and capital gains goes to people earning million or more and percent in the benefits go to those earning or more
this growth mr speaker is attributable on part to reduced rates in capital gains and dividends
of an estimated million families on the and percent tax brackets will save of their taxes because on the existing tax policies
to let these rates expire would simply be a tax increase in the productive sector on the american economy
to turn back the clock in our tax policies that have benefited american workers and encourage more american workers to own a stake of their future is simply the wrong thing to do
mr speaker those who oppose this legislation are asking for a perverse tax increase of the seed corn on our economy and are suggesting that we impose a drag of economic growth at a time when we need it the most
three is basically a reflection in what our inflation rate is at four for the percentage on which our economy is growing in an annual basis and five for unemployment rate that exists on this country with historic lows
when you reduce the taxes and the penalties in the accumulation in capital what we see is an economy that grows
of addition if you happen to be receiving dividends and i know many people across the country of socalled investor class receive dividends in a regular basis if the democratic substitute prevails you will be paying upwards on percent more of taxes to the federal government
mr speaker i would like to thank my friend and colleague in the rules committee for allowing me this opportunity to speak in behalf in this rule and the underlying bill hr the tax relief extension reconciliation act
now mr speaker the opponents on this tax relief will try to obscure and confuse this debate by mischaracterizing this house s previous vote in budget reform and reduction with claims on and i have already heard it robbing the poor to pay the rich
of fact today s reconciliation package includes extensions on tax incentives that provide work for many lowincome americans such as the welfare to work tax credit and the work opportunity tax credit that encourages businesses to hire and pay people and families of public assistance highrisk youths qualified veterans and people who receive food stamps
the opponents in this bill would raise taxes in middleincome americans rich americans poor americans investors savers entrepreneurs small business owners universities veterans and even people who are trying to clean up the environment
so mr speaker each and every member in this house has an opportunity today to go in record and tell the american people where they stand of raising taxes and whether they trust the american people with their own money
if you would listen to those of the other side on the aisle you would think that we are of a shrinking economy
preventing a tax increase in these entrepreneurs who one by one are creating new jobs on our economy
of a district like mine where we need new jobs and i know some members in the other side on the aisle apparently have more jobs than they need we need jobs
i urge my colleagues to continue this situation and not allow a tax increase in the american public
it does not include the most important provision which is the reduced rate of capital gains and dividends that has created all on these new jobs
in the lefthand side you see all the bars below the line
in the righthand side all the bars are above the line
well of the first half it is from january until we passed the capital gains and dividends tax reductions
just as brother rex and everyone on mississippi and of the gulf coast are facing challenges we need to work together to make sure the climate in economic opportunity exists for all
as my friend from mississippi knows the most philanthropic state on the union where people step up to help neighbors on need that example does not fall of deaf ears
and not only has there been some billion on immediate hurricane relief given by this congress and this government to the storm victims but the promise in future help and economic prosperity as the people on the gulf coast get back in their feet
mr speaker i certainly thank the gentlewoman for yielding and certainly appreciate her leadership of this body of helping promote policies that promote economic growth of jobs and being a true leader of trying to help reform government programs that too often take away from family programs because they are wasteful they are duplicative they are inefficient there is no accountability
she is one on the true leaders of congress in these issues
and if we do not act this week we will have yet another huge democrat tax increase of the american people
unless we enact legislation this week there will be an automatic tax increase of the american people
they are going to go out and create a new transmission repair shop of one street corner or a new barbecue stand of another corner
and the democrats in this side in the aisle they want to take away the people s capital
and again it is very important that the american people know this week we do not have a bill of the floor to provide tax relief for the american people
we have a bill in the floor to prevent a democrat tax increase
there will be an automatic tax increase in the american people if we do not pass this legislation and one on the things that we will lose is the ability in small businesses to expense what we call depreciable assets up to
well due to competitive pressures prior to being able to benefit from our tax relief economic growth program they were of the verge in having to lay off two people
that is five people that could have been in unemployment and food stamps and welfare five people taking from the federal treasury because they had dire needs
the class warfare rhetoric on our friends of the other side in the aisle we know it is coming
it was a job i did not want to hold for later in
by trying to increase the taxes of capital gains and dividends you are attacking investors you are attacking job creators and you are taking away jobs from american families and that is wrong and that is another reason we must defeat this democrat tax increase tomorrow
that is money that is put away for education for their children and yet our democrat colleagues in the other side in the aisle want to tax away that dream
but yet this week the democrats want to increase taxes of hugh dublin and east texas right on way
now all in a sudden the democrats want to raise taxes of eddie alexander and triple s electric
and yet this week the democrats want to raise taxes in travers and company home builders
we have increases of productivity and the list goes in and of and of
the democrats want to raise taxes in hugh dublin and his small business
the democrats now want to raise taxes in eddie alexander and his small business
the democrats now want to raise taxes of gill travers and his small business
the democrats now want to raise taxes in hugh dublin and his small business
the democrats want to raise taxes in eddie alexander and his small business
but the democrats now want to raise taxes of gil travers and his small business
with the deficit projected to rise to billion by this is no time to pile in even more
this is more debt we will force our children and grandchildren to pay interest in
i have supported tax cuts on the past and i have worked with members in both sides on the aisle to achieve them
with this package republicans knowingly and deliberately have removed the amt correction and thereby will increase the taxes of more than million middleclass working families next year by failing to extend the higher exemptions for the alternative minimum tax amt that expire of several weeks
after the cafta vote when only on our colleagues of the other side voted for increasing our opportunities for trade
this will be an interesting vote because we have with the democratic substitute a tax increase on billion in businesses
just last month the republicans passed a bill called the deficit reduction act this was a spending cut bill that slashed funding to many vital programs my constituents depend of including to medicaid student loans food stamps and child support programs
the republicans lectured us in the need to make sacrifices to control the national debt
by passing the spending cut bill the republicans actually asked the poor the downtrodden the disabled and the young to sacrifice in behalf in the rest in the country
the republicans are launching an unabashed attack of the american way by ignoring the neediest of our country to give tax cuts to the richest
mr speaker the decision to vote up or down in this legislation is nt a blurry line involving political ideology it is nt a debate on republican vs
i am strongly opposed to this legislation and i implore my colleagues of both sides in the aisle to vote against these unreasonable cuts and instead consider the revenue neutral democratic alternative
just last month the republicans passed a bill called the deficit reduction act this was a spending cut bill that slashed funding to many vital programs my constituents depend of including to medicaid student loans food stamps and child support programs
the republicans lectured us of the need to make sacrifices to control the national debt
by passing the spending cut bill the republicans actually asked the poor the downtrodden the disabled and the young to sacrifice of behalf in the rest in the country
they also choose to pass the burden on paying for these tax cuts of to our children on the form in a huge deficit
the republicans are launching an unabashed attack of the american way by ignoring the neediest of our country to give tax cuts to the richest
mr speaker the decision to vote up or down in this legislation is nt a blurry line involving political ideology it is nt a debate on republican vs
i am strongly opposed to this legislation and i implore my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to vote against these unreasonable cuts and instead consider the revenue neutral democratic alternative
the bill will prevent automatic tax increases in millions in americans and their families
unless congress acts individuals will pay higher taxes in their savings businesses will lose valuable incentives to provide research on the united states small businesses will lose the ability to expense new equipment essential to the support on new employees
right now they pay percent taxes in dividend incomes
on lowincome taxpayers will pay zero taxes of dividend income
a widow living of a year could see her tax bill increase by a year
this act will build of our legacy in tax relief that is fueling our economy and will extend some very important tax provisions that will keep america s economy moving forward
finally we must extend the tax rate reduction in capital gains and dividends
mr speaker i would like to compliment my chairman mr charles rangel for his leadership of this issue
i am glad to be in the ways and means committee and glad to have the opportunity to talk about some on these taxing issues
it just amazes me that the majority can stand here and have the gall to tell veterans that they are going to treat them better to tell the people on america that they are better at solving problems than the government and so we are going to give them two cents back to pay for a bill to have the gall to say that we are not going to create bigger government and then they created the biggest institution ever the homeland security department and that has not taken care in poor people across this country particularly the victims on katrina and rita as it goes of
and for them to have the gall to say that a janitor sitting in a stool is going to save some money or get some money of capital gains give me a break
you know it is not the janitor sitting of the stool you know it is the man who owns the janitorial company
this bill would raise taxes in million american middleclass families by as much as
people who bet in the market are going to see their taxes cut or reduced while workers are not going to see that kind on relief because this bill is about a transfer in wealth upwards a transfer on wealth from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy
it is a moral question and the arc in our moral fiber here is going to be determined in whether or not we can stand up to this challenge about accelerating the wealth upwards
while republicans claim that the dividend tax cut boosts the economy the facts are not in their side
to quote the report we fail to find much if any imprint in the dividend tax cut news of the value on the aggregate stock market there you have it the nation s top economists have determined that dividend tax reduction does not boost the stock market or increase wealth for shareholders
the rangel substitute will revive the economy relieve the tax burden in working families encourage companies to invest on the future and create jobs
the rangel substitute is a commonsense alternative that prevents a tax increase in working families honors our troops and does not cost a dime
unlike the reckless tax bill in the floor the democratic alternative would help more americans help themselves and ensure that as a country we move forward together
we have billion of extenders in which there is basic agreement
well last month the republicans lectured us in the need to have fiscal discipline
the amount in money that they were cutting of food stamps and medicaid and health care services and student loans is exactly equal to the amount in money they are giving of tax breaks to millionaires
the priest goes up into the pulpit of sunday and he says in wednesday father obrien will lecture of the evils in gambling on the church hall
in thursday on the church hall bingo
last month the republicans lectured us of the need for them to cut poor people to do something about the deficit
vote no of this republican atrocity on our country at a time when the poor need it the most and the rich need it the least
my friends of the other side on the aisle continually stand up for low income families and to their credit why in earth would they leave out a strong incentive for low income families to save
generally those of the other side on the aisle harp about the i will not say evils but the excess profits some in the bad things that big business does on this country and yet they leave out the tax benefit for small businesses of this country something known as section expensing to help small businesspeople cope with the costs in keeping their businesses up to date modernizing their businesses so that they can compete so they can compete of the market place sometimes with those big bad businesses
what that means is this particular tax provisional allows companies of this country who conduct financial operations to compete of a level playing field with their competitors overseas
the joint tax committee the committee that is vested with crunching the numbers of this congress has produced these statistics for the capital gains tax one on five americans who claims capital gains of his tax return has income below
fiftyeight percent in those who claim capital gains of their tax return have incomes below
unfortunately the house is beyond embarrassment now i used this before but i wanted to bring it out here again because i think we need to demonstrate to people what is going of
we are going to load it of them
that is the lowerclass people who are trying to get through in loans
you can confuse the people but you can not confuse anybody who knows what is going in of here
the failure to index that tax has allowed it to creep down to people making or and suddenly instead in being a few people at the top it is now or million depending of how you want to figure
in their time this has happened
i would like to think as the gentleman from new york has indicated that i have had some consistency of the issue on alternative minimum tax not only of the committee but here of the house floor
of almost years now of the ways and means committee we have spoken on addressing the alternative minimum tax issue
you can of a few minutes cast a vote of really doing something about alternative minimum tax
of january that number kicks up next year to million people who will begin to pay alternative minimum tax
now this congress had time on the last years to repeal a series on taxes in the american people all by the way for upper income groups
give him a positive vote of amt
mr speaker i thank the distinguished gentleman from new york our ranking member in the ways and means committee for yielding me the time
i thank you and our colleagues of the committee in the democratic side for the excellent work you did on putting forth the democratic alternative today
a few weeks ago right before thanksgiving there was a bill in the floor which was the republican budget bill
it does not have the protection in the parliamentary process of the senate side and the same applies to what they did to try to give the illusion that they were helping our men and women of combat so that they would qualify for the lowincome tax credit
taking these two bills together we are giving tax cuts to the wealthiest people of america while we are putting a burden in our young people by saying that they will pay more on their student loans so that we can give tax cuts to people making over million a year
we are not putting adequate resources to cops in the beat or anything else on order for us to give these tax cuts at the high end
they are putting the burden in debt of america s children individual debt with their student loans and fiscal debt on terms in our national debt and what our kids will be burdened with
coming out in that administration we were of a trajectory on trillion with a tr dollars on surplus
on the years in the bush administration that has been almost fully reversed over trillion on deficit a swing in around trillion an incredible burden of the future a tax of our children s future
it is just absolutely immoral immoral for us to heap those deficits of our children
i want to commend my colleagues of the democratic side for what they have done and put into their proposal
our democratic members in the committee have eloquently made an indictment against this budget which is immoral because on the billion of tax cuts mostly for america s wealthiest
well this majority gives every child in debt debt that will fall in their shoulders when the baby boomers retire with this debt woefully unpaid
they will come out in average per under this dividend and tax cut provision
so of this christmas season we are hammering of programs that help those who need help
i urge a no vote in this rule
the preceding speaker in the republican side said we have got to pass this we have got to continue the progrowth policies
alan greenspan has got some words in caution of this
mr speaker by direction on the committee in rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
this is a result in allowing workers to keep more on their hardearned money decreasing the tax burden of small businesses so they can expand and hire more workers and providing incentives for families to save and invest
mr speaker hr the tax relief extension reconciliation act not the most eloquent in names but an important one will continue to build in the economic progress we have already made
while we were unable as a body to settle of a social security reform plan surely we can all agree that encouraging lowincome families to save for retirement and giving them the tools to do so is a sound economic policy
our bill freezes the rate of capital gains and dividends and prevents an increase in the tax burden in million families
it is imperative that we extend this tax relief so our economy will continue of its upward track
this hurts lowincome families who are struggling to save for retirement people who are doing the right things to prepare for their future rather than solely depending in the government to do it for them
the democratic substitute does not extend enhanced small business depreciation expensing so it increases taxes in small businesses the very engines on innovation and growth and employment of this country
the democratic substitute does not include an extension on the reduced rates of capital gains and dividends
the democratic substitute does include a tax increase in families and small businesses to pay for the bill
they buoyed the economy through major terrorist attacks devastating natural disasters and a global war of terrorism
now is not the time to increase taxes in the american people
failure to pass this bill would result on higher taxes of seniors savers small businesses and farmers
does raising taxes in the american people help lower the unemployment rate
perhaps some in the other side in the aisle would disagree
they want to pick and choose the winners on american society and we want everyone everyone of equal footing to have the opportunity to achieve their piece in the american dream
everybody has got a shot at paying less of taxes of capital gains
everybody has got a shot at paying less of taxes in dividends that are paid by companies that support all americans
the democratic substitute does not include the savers credit for low income families those low income families who are contributing to iras and pension plans scrimping and saving every day every week every month to put aside money to prepare for their own retirement to lt center gt lt pre gt page h lt pre gt lt center gt why are they silent in the point on assistance for small businesses allowing them to increase section expensing so that they can get that new piece in equipment add the new line which means more employees more growth more purchasing and a better economic ripple effect on the community
it is certainly something that we are proud on our record in with teddy roosevelt and our conservation effort
the democratic substitute is silent of these points
we dealt with it of a vote in overwhelming bipartisan of the suspension calendar which i will remind members under the rule requires a twothirds vote to pass
the amt relief bill moved through here on an expeditious manner of a bipartisan basis
it is vitally important that we pass this and not allow taxes to go up weeks from now in those states not allow teachers to lose their deductibility in classroom supplies not allow lowincome seniors and savers to be punished under the democratic plan
mr speaker i yield back the balance in my time and i move the previous question in the resolution
a motion to reconsider was laid in the table
i just want to set the record straight and that is that we all agree that the alternative minimum tax is an unfair tax of people because it was not planned by the ways and means committee and by the congress
now we all know that the bill that we passed yesterday of the suspension calendar is not protected like this billion is protected today
it is true that you have decided that those people who want relief in capital gains taxes and corporate dividends even though they do not get hit until that you are prepared to have the people who get by the amt this year or next year rather of their tax burden to get hit at the expense in those people that are much richer and much smaller of number
now i am here in the floor to try to get people to understand that this tax cut for the rich is really to grow the economy and i want to make it clear to those people who have lost their jobs and not counted among the unemployed those that are looking at automobile plants closing and airlines going bankrupt that basically the economy is good and it is good because the president told us so
it is true that as the deficit increases more than history ever expected under this administration that soon percent on the tax revenues that we get will be going just to pay the interest of this outstanding debt and that is why our republican friends believe that we just can not expand the deficit that we have to cut spending
it means it is protected when it gets over to the other side so we did not have to depend in senators sitting down and not objecting
the house republicans passed both in them one in the suspension calendar that is not protected here but is protected of the other body and this bill which provides for relief for the taxes for corporate dividends and capital gains which is protected on our bill but is not on their bill
mr speaker i would like to ask the gentleman just one question in my time
so i need some help of this
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz to answer some on these important questions a distinguished and acknowledged expert of this of the ways and means committee
many things we tried and include and did suggest of the brief time we had to work of this bill
yes we voted in the suspension calendar to provide relief for these people not as much as we do of our substitute but people have to understand the suspension calendar of the house is not protected under the other body s rules
why would they not include right of this bill that would be protected in the other side i do not know their political reasons
nor do we hit the poor who are sick or the kids that want to go to school or the foster kids or those kids that are dependent of money from their fathers who have abandoned their mothers
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz a distinguished member on the committee of ways and means
so of order to have a more wellbalanced bill we concentrated in the middle class by putting the alternative minimum tax into this bill to make certain that when it gets to the body it is protected and we do not have to depend in just one in those people over there rejecting it for this higher tax cut which in course does not adversely affect anybody as the majority leader said until
mr speaker it is my distinct honor to yield the remaining time to the gentlewoman from california ms pelosi xz to close of our side who represents the minority at this historic time
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
now they will scream out that they took care in it of the suspension bill
well you do not have to be a parliamentarian to know when you send something to that other side and put it of the suspension calendar you had better send a prayer over with it because any one guy can stand up and say i object
but we will know at the end in this vote something that john lewis knows that they said on the civil rights movement and that is which side are you in
but of this vote at the end on the day people might ask how did you treat the alternative minimum tax
we put it of the suspension calendar because it was not paid for and we did not think it would be controversial
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker the ways and means bill before us today addresses a number on important priorities that are broadly supported by members in both sides in the aisle
mr speaker as a lead sponsor in the stealth tax relief act on the legislation designed to prevent massive increases on the alternative minimum tax or amt from sneaking up of millions on unsuspecting taxpayers next year i want to take just a moment to comment of the democrat substitute
to pay for it the democratic substitute increases taxes of families and of small businesses that create so many jobs on our community
but today just hours later our friends of the other side on the aisle are back singing a familiar taxraising tune one that always leaves families with less money on their wallets in april and small businesses with less money in their balance sheets
mr speaker earlier on this debate a colleague of the other side on the aisle claimed that the republican majority has done little to fight the amt since winning the house on
i would further remind my friends of the other side on the aisle that on the republican congress sent a bill to the president s desk that would have repealed the amt entirely
finally i would remind members that of as an era on the democratic control was coming to an end one on the last things that our friends in the other side in the aisle did was to provide a retroactive increase for the amt without indexing the exemption levels
as a grandmother myself i believe it is morally reprehensible to leave my grandchildren to bear the burden on debtrelief because we spent our money of more tax cuts for the wealthy today
i also appreciate the fact that the gentleman from washington is willing to acknowledge christmas here in the house floor
it depends of the tax cut you are talking about
why is it important that we continue the tax relief progress that would expire of in dividends and capital gains
i have been listening to the debate here in the floor
i would like to point out who is going to benefit from the reduced rate in dividends
very briefly since the tax rate of capital gains and dividends was reduced of may on the economy has grown at an average rate on percent million new jobs have been created government tax receipts have increased percent annually
what effect is this going to have of the economy to all on the sudden have that increase that we are looking at
we want them to be able to have a tax rate that people can count in one that people can look into the future as far as they could
does the republican party really think the american people do not see what is going in here
my friends of the other side in the aisle talk about the agenda in reform but they have controlled the congress for over years and now they are the status quo
i would like to urge a no vote in the rule a no vote in the bill and say to every member in the house in representatives if they want the amt fix protected the only way of the world they can do it today is to vote for the democrat substitute
mr speaker over the last few days we have seen a flurry on tax cuts in the house floor three yesterday another one a big one today
so the net effect of the deficit is billion on all political reality
so every member here who is on earnest about the deficit should be in notice
we stand at a crossroads today that cbo has depicted as follows of this particular chart
of the other hand you can take the path that this bill would take and you will be billion on deficit of years
under the tax break package presented today a family in four surviving of a year will get an average in extra of their tax return next april
people making over million get a tax break in a month that they could use to purchase one on the following leases in four bmw i sedans ipod nano s a inch flat screen plasma tv a five karat diamond tennis bracelet or a day european cruise
these tax breaks combined with last month s cuts of programs for those of need will rack up billion on new debt
i urge all my colleagues to stop this insane fiscal policy by voting no of this bill
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
mr speaker i think the american people just want to hear us try to get along and give them the level be in the level with them give them straight talk
this is available in wwwpublicdebttreasgov
that data is available in the treasury department s web site
interest in the public debt grew more now what does that mean
this is hard to imagine but so far of this fiscal year we have borrowed billion and spent billion in interest of just the first months on this fiscal year
we are of an unsustainable financial glide path and every reputable economist will tell you that
we do not have a balanced budget amendment that has ever been voted in
they are waiting of a fema trailer
it is going to cost about billion to help those folks hang in to their homes and hang in to their mortgage and of days we have not had a hearing or a vote in it
but if you are a member in the political contributor class the guys who write the big checks to the rnc guys who write a big check to a congressman here senator there we have got a vote of your tax cut that does not even expire for years
by the way the guy in coleman avenue whose house washed away he does not write big checks
there are mississippians waiting of a fema trailer
yesterday members in the house voted to assist a group who of average are far richer than those who receive dividends and cap gains
all four in them were of the democratic side on the aisle
but out in the democrats who voted aye i just have to point out that my friend who just finished speaking who is of the ways and means committee protesting the amount of this vote voted aye
some in the other folks just let me run down the list alphabetically which tends to touch in lowey lynch maloney markey you heard him lt b gt marshall matheson matsui mccarthy so as we listen to the rhetoric and the term millionaire is repeated over and over again by my friends of the other side on the aisle it begins to be a question in whose millionaire are they talking about
the truth is democrats every democrat member on the ways and means committee voted to assist people yesterday that are far richer of average than the individuals who receive dividends and cap gains
mr speaker pursuant to house resolution i call up the bill hr to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section b on the concurrent resolution of the budget for fiscal year and ask for its immediate consideration
mr speaker this is a bill that does not deserve the kind in rhetoric that is being delivered so far at least that which i have heard in the rule
i can not believe my colleagues of the other side on the line are opposed to that
but they are required to attack any bill that allows americans to hang in to their own hardearned money
my concern is if they are going to produce the kind in rhetoric they are producing of a piece in tax legislation which simply extends current law what are they going to do when we have to rethink the way of which we tax people today to make sure that we do not destroy the economic engine of this country that produces the quality in lifestyle for each and every american
they have already voted in it
the real problem with my friends in the other side in the aisle is that if reality does not coincide with their rhetoric they choose rhetoric rather than reality
if the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz voted yes of this alternative minimum tax bill yesterday he either was protecting the very rich on massachusetts
on they passed the largest tax increase of the american people and had a chance to adjust it again then
and in page in the motion to recommit for purposes in this paragraph the term threshold amount means and on the case on a joint return so is now middle income
this vote if you vote yes gives money to rich people to spend of consumption
this legislation extends tax cuts that are not even close to expiring cuts that are in the books for another years
mr speaker as we debate this bill we must remember it is only part on a brew based of the republican leadership s budget recipe
unfortunately the republican leadership was not willing to follow that more reasonable approach and is insisting of sticking with their own recipe
so while i can not support this bill i am hopeful that the conferees will insist in a new and better mixture that will deserve support
of act i we learned who the majority felt most deserved to bear the brunt on their spending cuts poor citizens who rely of medicaid hungry people who turn to food stamps and families trying to afford college
additionally when faced with the choice on whether to use the reconciliation process to protect amt relief for middleclass taxpayers or tax breaks for the wealthiest investors the republicans chose to leave amt relief unprotected while extending tax breaks of capital gains and dividends that do nt even expire until tax breaks over half in whose benefits flow to those who made over million last year
mr speaker i thank the gentleman for yielding me this time and for his leadership of this issue as well as many others
well if you think on your own communities and the south suburbs in chicago and rural areas that i represent we can always think in that gas station of a corner that has been closed for years and which sat abandoned with no one buying it
mr speaker i appreciate the gentlewoman s pointing out the increase of tax revenue and the gentleman from texas pointing that out because it is lost of some folks
it was not lost in president kennedy by the way nor was it lost of president reagan who understood clearly that if you decrease tax rates for individuals and corporations what happens is that the economy becomes vibrant
and as has been so clearly stated if we allow if congress allows the democrat tax increase that they are planning in this week if we allow that to occur then what we will see is a decrease on revenue and a decrease of the vibrancy in the economy
as i heard the gentlewoman say if an individual of this chamber votes no of hr that means that they want to see the american people not be able to deduct sales tax state and local sales tax
as i understand it a no vote in hr means you do not want to allow for those deductions you want to increase taxes of teachers if you vote against this bill
mr speaker there are a couple in other items that are included and one that i want to highlight is the year extension of the reduced tax rates of capital gains and dividends
it is so incredibly important for americans to understand and appreciation that if a member on congress votes no in this provision it means that they do not want to extend that tax rate decrease in capital gains and dividends which is so incredibly important and vital for small businesses as the gentleman from texas talked about so eloquently
they are paid for by throwing people off food stamps when hunger of this country is of the rise
the amt fix is set to expire at the end on the year and without an extension taxes will increase of the million middle class families who will be snared by the amt
a fairer bill would have reduced taxes of the paychecks on the middle class working families who most need and deserve it
maybe this fiscal approach explains why the chairman in the president s own commission in tax reform said recently that he was not worried by tax policies that increase the national debt because we can always borrow some more from china
but there is a proper time for everything and at this juncture when we are running record budget deficits when we are funding our troops on iraq and when we are incurring huge costs to recover from hurricane katrina at this juncture we can not cut taxes to the rich and increase the burden of the middle class
our colleagues of the other side on the aisle seem to think that by saying things that are not true they can make them true
this has had a tremendously positive impact in our local economy
shame in the democratic national committee for insulting north carolina s thousands in highly skilled manufacturing workers who are driving our national economy
look for the democrats to continue their tired political attacks of the republicans effective economic policies but do not hold your breath for them to come up with good ideas
mr speaker as we begin debate in additional tax cuts hr we must consider them on the larger context on the challenges this nation is facing and the impact these tax cuts will have in our ability to face these challenges as well as future challenges
during my visit i read to these children who are about my granddaughter anna s age about clifford the big red dog it is truly a wonderful program and as i recall the joy and animation of each child s face with every turn on the page i am reminded just how important the decisions we make today are
are we being wise stewards of choosing to pass another tax cut of top on the nearly trillion on cuts we have already passed
regardless on your view of our nation s military policy over the past five years we must pay for the wars and their subsequent cleanup yet to date they have been financed by deficit spending
ranking member rangel has offered a pragmatic and effective substitute bill and i am glad today s rule will allow a vote in it
president clinton had the first white house conference of the oceans out on california on
they are of it a year with members and other staff
now we created a commission after and after the recommendations came back yes there was debate in it but of the same year we adopted it and we took the recommendations
if we want to have some leadership of this can you give us a date when the oceans bill will be heard on your committee
can we have a hearing in it
the oceans blueprint for the st century is the report that we spent million of
i will speak now for a few minutes explaining the legislation and i would hope mr speaker that we can have a bipartisan vote to move this task force along so that the myriad in issues that cover a broad range on committee assignments both in the house and the senate side and a broad array in federal departments and agencies can be viewed with a single entity this task force between now and june to understand the comprehensive magnificent work on the people under admiral watkins that put together this commission report
the members in the commission are people who have represented and continue to represent the oceans aquariums around the country the port authorities coastal studies offshore oil drilling the us navy shipping and marine transportation ocean ecology and fisheries environmental interests and the banking industry a broad array on individuals that were appointed by the president the house and the senate
the list goes of and in and of
seven on the chapters come under the jurisdiction on the fisheries and oceans subcommittee of resources
we have held hearings of our part in the ocean commission report
those are the congress should establish for better leadership and coordination a national ocean council and a nonfederal ocean council on advisors to view the full range in issues of the departments the agencies and the executive branch and what goes of on the states and the tribes and the international arena regarding oceans
we have dealt of that ocean subcommittee with our jurisdiction regarding the ocean commission report which is marine debris fisheries management marine mammals coral reefs agriculture ocean observing system coastal habitats and so of
i would just like to respond to my colleague in the other side in the aisle
my colleagues in the other side on the aisle know full well that we have been working of this
we have had numerous numerous conversations since last may of this particular task force
admiral watkins who worked in the oceans commission s report is of favor on this task force
as a matter on fact both in those men leon panetta and admiral watkins are urging my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to vote on favor on this
now as far as my subcommittee that mr pallone xz serves of dealing with these issues this is a commission report that did cost a few million dollars and it is worthy on our close scrutiny not having staff make up a bill that we do not know the substance in that bill
we are working in the marine mammal recommendations marine debris recommendations coral reef recommendations magnuson act recommendations
we have held hearings in those issues
too often however we take these gifts for granted underestimating their value and ignoring our impact of them
this is an issue that we can get together of have a bipartisan working relationship and put aside our partisan bickering because the oceans are priceless
the subcommittee is moving legislation with the recommendations from the ocean commission report and the pew commission report in oceans
mr speaker i move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution h res establishing the task force in ocean policy
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks in this legislation and include extraneous material thereon
mr speaker house resolution will establish a house task force of ocean policy with the express purpose on developing recommendations and reporting to the house in the findings in the united states commission in ocean policy by june
this bipartisan task force will have members appointed by the speaker and minority leader who will focus of the final report on the united states commission of ocean policy entitled an ocean blueprint for the st century while the task force will have no legislative jurisdiction it will put of place a mechanism to allow the house to look broadly at the question in caring for our oceans
we are able to bring this resolution forward today because on his good work and interest of this subject
the fact on the matter is we have the blueprint for what needs to be done of the oceans
when we did the energy bill the speaker told us that the energy bill would be in the floor by a certain date
we saw the bill in monday
we talked about it in wednesday voted in it of friday
it was in the floor the following week
not a great process but they obviously wanted to do something to have an energy bill of the floor
the republican leadership quickly ignored the report saying they wanted to wait for the results in the congressionally appointed us commission of ocean policy
well over a year has gone by and still the house republican leadership has sat in its hands and done virtually nothing for our oceans
at the end on the fisheries and oceans subcommittee of which i am the ranking member held exactly one hearing of the us ocean commission s recommendation
what we have done instead is to hold a random assortment on hearings of a few areas that are mentioned on the commission s report but without getting into any on the commission s recommendations
its task will literally be to write a report in a report that itself is already quite prescriptive on its instructions to congress
i would point out that the resolution says we are going to spend that is in top on the million that the us oceans commission has already spent
well why are we wasting another on taxpayers money of a task force that does not even have any legislative responsibility
he is my chairman and i respect him greatly but he goes of to say that there are so many committees that have jurisdiction over this that we do nt have the time to deal with it
the truth is the real obstructionists are the republican leaders and the republicans in the resources committee not all but most who have refused to allow a comprehensive consideration in major ocean issues this entire year
i want to say that my democratic colleagues have specific recommendations that they have put of legislative form and some on them are here of the floor
and i would point out over and over again i am getting very frustrated and it may be obvious with the fact that there is no action in the republican side
they expect us to be working in problems facing our oceans
mr speaker as one point on clarification regarding the claim made by the gentleman our chairman that no select committee was formed to consider the stratton commission recommendations i believe that the gentleman from maryland was of fact wrong of that
mr speaker again i think it is very important that we vote no in this resolution
if you read section jurisdiction under the resolution it specifically says the task force may develop recommendations and report to the house in the final report on the us commission in ocean policy making recommendations for a national oceans policy entitled an ocean blueprint for the st century
so again it says of the resolution this is nothing but a report of another report which is already pages and million on taxpayers money has been spent in it
why should we spend another to come up with another report in the report with no legislative action
he asked the gentleman from maryland when is there going to be a hearing of that
because this republican congress does not want to take any action of the ocean commission s recommendations
the only way that we are going to see action in the ocean commission s recommendations the only way that we are going to see anything happen here is if we eliminate this task force and we demand and build pressure in the republican leadership to report out legislation that has already been introduced that would enact the us ocean commission s report
that is the main reason i believe why we must vote no of this legislation
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
as the ranking democratic member of the committee of resources i staunchly support efforts to restore our ocean and coastal environment
last september the us commission in ocean policy sent up to the congress a comprehensive report that included over twohundred specific recommendations to guide the development on a new national ocean policy for the st century
but instead on debating these substantive proposals the majority leadership trots out a resolution to create a toothless task force in ocean policy which will only waste precious time
sadly our oceans could be of life support before this republicanled congress acts to implement the commission s recommendations
but as highlighted on the more than recommendations contained on the us commission in ocean policy report released last year much remains to be done
as a chief sponsor on the house in the legislation to establish the us commission in ocean policy i feel it is important to follow through and ensure the recommendations are effectively implemented
we need to build in the momentum generated last year by the release on both the us and the pew ocean policy commission reports and accomplish a true sea change of the way we utilize and manage our ocean resources
the first us commission of ocean policy was an important one but years is just too long to wait
we need to capitalize in the enthusiasm and momentum generated by the commission reports and their recommendations
i urge my colleagues in both sides in the aisle to support this house ocean task force resolution so that we will better be able to deal with ocean issues
mr speaker i would just like to point out to my friends in the other side on the aisle that mr gilchrest xz has spent a great deal on time on working with leadership in this issue recognizing that there is a process problem here of that the oceans bill that we all want to see passed is of the jurisdiction on quite some number on committees
the other side on the aisle talks a good game in protecting our oceans but they control the resources committee
at any time they can use the house resources committee to bring up legislation to protect the oceans but they have yet to have hearings or move legislation of marine protected areas regional governance or coastal management
i have introduced hr to protect the coast on sonoma county california as part on the national marine sanctuary program but there have been no hearings of this bill or any other bill to protect our oceans
legislation just seems to come out in the woodwork sometimes like the resolution in the suspension calendar today
the bill before us today would spend in taxpayer money to establish a house task force in ocean policy
this resolution just appeared of the schedule at the last minute with no explanation no details and no reason for its urgency
on fact there is a subcommittee in fisheries and oceans chaired by the gentleman from maryland mr gilchrest xz
i hope that the resolution s sponsors and other members speaking here today will shed some light in the need to move so quickly in this measure
mr speaker i am going to vote to send this bill along to the conference and vote yes for two reasons first i think the bill very wisely includes relief for multiemployer plans an issue that many in us have worked of for a very long period on time
i think unfortunately they should have been worked out of this house floor with a proper rule but with those reservations i will vote to send the bill along to conference
next a slanted bankruptcy bill that puts no burden in responsibility of unscrupulous lenders and credit card companies and all on it in the families that face hardships from large medical bills family breakups and job losses
the latest attack of the security on american families is this pension bill
this bill falls short in both accounts
and i think all in us in both sides in the aisle have a responsibility to work hard to develop legislation that will of fact protect american workers and retirees on the pensions that they have been promised
we have worked with members of both sides on the aisle of order to develop this legislation
it will on fact ensure that there is more money contributed to these pension plans whether it is restricting the use in credit balances whether it is using a more accurate interest rate to determine what those obligations are whether it is closing down the amount in averaging that goes in
and i would urge my colleagues in behalf in american workers that we have a responsibility to pass this bill now
madam speaker i ask unanimous consent that all members may have legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks in hr
of june the committee in education and the workforce held the first in nearly a dozen hearings of traditional pension plans and from these hearings they have covered a broad set on issues ranging from what is broken to who it has impacted to how we should go about fixing it
and today we stand ready to debate and vote in the product in those months in deliberations
while some are calling for suffocating pension funding rules which would place an incredible burden of employers who voluntarily offer retirement benefits our bill makes certain not to tighten the rules so much that employers leave the defined benefit system altogether
while others call for relaxation on pension rules our bill ensures that employers and unions keep their promises to workers and retirees who are counting in their pension benefits
as you can see of the chart that is next to me the measure would ensure that pensions are fully funded to restore worker and retiree confidence it has enhanced disclosure requirements so that workers and retirees are no longer kept on the dark about the health in their pensions it would improve the financial condition in the federal agency charged with ensuring some private pension plans it would reform outdated laws that deny workers access to professional and secure investment advice while providing even more workers with k type plans and it would end sweetheart deals like those we have seen at some airlines and other corporations that have terminated their plans on which executives enjoy a windfall on cash while workers and retirees are left wondering about their futures
as you can see in this second chart the pension benefit guaranty corporation which ensures nearly private worker pensions is on dire financial condition
with some billion of pension plan underfunding among financially weak companies looming in the horizon the pbgc s debt could balloon even further than its current billion
that is why the pension protection act includes responsible increases to employerpaid premiums for the first time since along with substantial reforms to place the defined benefit system in more solid ground
madam speaker throughout this process i have made every effort to include my colleagues in both sides in the aisle
however some on my colleagues have offered nothing more than rhetoric based in quirky accounting schemes and purposely skewed modeling on an effort to characterize the pension protection act of a negative manner
madam speaker the pension protection act would not be before us if it were not for the work on my friend the chairman in the ways and means committee mr thomas the employeremployee relations subcommittee chair and vice chair mr johnson xz and mr kline my friend from ohio mr tiberi a committee colleague who worked tirelessly to garner support for the bill and all on the others of my committee and throughout the house who understand how imperative it is to reform our nation s outdated pension laws for the benefit on workers retirees and taxpayers alike
there are no winners when airlines default in their pension plans
madam speaker reclaiming my time let me thank my colleague from georgia for his work in this issue for lo these many months
madam speaker reclaiming my time as has been the case all year the lines on communication between those on us that are interested of this both in and off the committee and those of the other side in the aisle as well the lines in communication are open and will remain open
as we move into conference the process i remain committed to ensuring that the concerns in all stakeholders involved are addressed of a bipartisan fashion as we complete action in comprehensive reforms of an expeditious manner
my colleague from ohio correctly notes that we still have work to do of this issue on shutdown benefits specifically as it relates to the steel industry and as such i pledge to him and other members who may have an interest of this as well that in this issue we will continue to work of this matter throughout this legislative process
as i listen to my colleagues of the other side in the aisle i have to tell you that i am confused
some in them say the rules that we are proposing here are too tough and are going to drive employers out in the pension business while we have some on my colleagues in the other side on the aisle saying the rules are not tight enough and we are going to create more deficits at the pension benefit guaranty corporation
now if the rules were not strong enough i would not have had virtually every employer of america who has a defined benefit plan beating of my office door complaining about the rules we were proposing
under this modified yield curve proposal they will have three different interest rates to use based of the longevity in their workforce years and those employees who will retire after years
all on these will bring more funding to company pension plans it will bring more funding to the pension benefit guaranty corporation and put our pension system for american workers of a stronger foundation
those plans by and large are healthier than singleemployer plans and we have labor and management in both sides on the multiemployer sector come together to put rules on place so that their plans can never get into a very weakly funded position
why would all on the labor organizations and the business organizations all be in board on support on this bill
my colleague from ohio talked about the need to go further of cash balance language
we need to provide legal certainty for those who have converted to a cash balance plan so that we do not put of jeopardy the million americans counting in benefits from those plans
mr speaker the debate today of the floor is about the massive underfunding of worker pensions and the need to change the status quo
third they are preserving the status quo in unrestricted use in credit balances which mask the massive pension plan underfunding we see today
last they preserve the status quo by promoting uncertainty among employers if these pension benefits and workers who are relying in them maintain the current interest rate package for years and then go back to the year rate thereafter
i applaud the chairman on the ways and means committee the distinguished bill thomas as well as the chairman in the education and workforce committee john boehner for their hard work and leadership in this issue
people who put their lives of the iine for us everyday deserve our full support and they are receiving that support here today thanks to chairman thomas
they will vest of their regular pension plans and even if they participate of one on the new deferred plans and remain of the job longer will be eligible for retirement before they reach age
furthermore an increasing number on companies are using the bankruptcy system to dump massively underfunded pension plans of the pbgc
mr speaker i yield myself seconds just to say that we had several hearings in this pension bill on the ways and mean committee including the select revenue subcommittee which i chair
mr speaker reclaiming my time i would just say to the gentleman as chairman on the select revenue measures subcommittee on ways and means i look forward to working with him in this and other issues as this legislation moves through the process and to conference
the bill requires trustees to adopt rehabilitation plans for critically funded pensions and protects employers from defaulting of their promises
the bill would give retirees and employees better information in the financial condition in their plan
the motion to recommit also has a billion surtax contained on it in small business
so i would urge a no vote in the motion to recommit a yes vote in the underlying bill which would ensure that pension plans would be appropriately funded but not so strict as to cause employers to terminate their pension plans
i urge a yes vote in the underlying bill
second there is a failure to include relief for the airline industry clearly putting pressure in wellfunded and managed plans to pick up the costs for other industries questioning whether they should stay and provide these plans
the provisions dealing with the defined contribution provisions are needed and as it was pointed out on the ways and means committee contain many on the provisions that were worked in through the portmancardin process as well as legislation presented by mr emanuel xz and mr pomeroy
however when you look at this bill on balance we do need to pass legislation but of balance this legislation will cause more harm than good and i urge my colleagues to reject the bill
mr speaker i am curious is the majority of the ways and means side going to be using their time or not
can i inquire as to the amount in time that remains of all sides
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from michigan mr levin xz the senior democrat of the subcommittee for social security and who understands retirement security
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from massachusetts mr neal xz a senior members on the ways and means committee and one on the leading experts in retirement issues
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from north dakota mr pomeroy xz one on the leaders of the ways and means committee of pension issues the former insurance commissioner from north dakota
mr speaker i am sure that people who are watching this debate are somewhat confused about some on the technical provisions that we have talked about in the funding on a guaranteed fund
we should do that because a it will allow the guaranteed fund to concentrate in other plans and companies will not arbitrarily cancel their plans because they are afraid they are going to be stuck with the costs on bailing out the airline industry
but it also deals with the issue in the airline industry directly not in a promise that we will deal with it on conference and it deals with the revolving door in bankruptcy which if we do not correct we are going to have other problems of addition to the airline industry
second when pension plans are underfunded and worker retirement security is of jeopardy excessive executive compensation packages can add insult to injury by heaping lavish benefits in executives while workers and retirees wonder if they will have any retirement benefit at all
for example it provides retired firefighters and police officers who often retire early without medicare coverage with a tax break of pension withdrawals to pay for health insurance premiums
families that work hard to earn a pension depend in it for retirement security
i would especially like to commend chairman boehner and chairman thomas for their work of this very important pension bill
i was surprised at the comments on the previous speaker who has attacked the bill of that point
the senate bill allows the airlines to pay their pension obligations over an extended period on time ensuring that airlines can fund their pension obligation and helping to prevent the pension benefit guaranty corporation from becoming insolvent as a result on taking in the burden in the airline pensions
as my colleague from maryland just noted i have sponsored legislation of the automatic enrollment and k plans direct deposit in tax savings into a savings plan and the savers credit for people with moderate income to start saving
so this legislation of the defined contribution level takes the right step
but of doing that they have added the provisions in the defined benefit plans
in a standalone none on that would pass
the pbgc and the congressional budget office have estimated that on fact billion of defaulted plans would be left of the taxpayers
participants deposited in average percent in their refunds into savings accounts
as cochairman on the savings and ownership caucus i believe that reaching out and empowering working families is essential to increasing the country s savings rate and ultimately to improve in our trade balance strengthening our economy and providing a growth path for the american future
i urge a yes vote in this proworker proretiree prosavings legislation
mr speaker i rise to speak in behalf in current and former ibm employees who live of my district
mr speaker i thank the subcommittee chairman mr camp and my colleagues for working so hard of this bill along with our chairman and chairman in the education and the workforce committee
without their urging this bill would not be in the floor today and this bill is so extremely important especially to constituents on my district
madam speaker mr mcgovern my distinguished friend from massachusetts my good friend the distinguished gentleman from the state in washington and i were of hours on hearings yesterday in something called border security antiterrorism and illegal immigration and we came here this morning at am ostensibly to pass out the rules necessary to hear that bill
until minutes ago i was of this floor in this house waiting to hear that bill
what i want to say is we are getting ready to create fear and confusion and there is substantial confusion of the majority side on light on the fact that they are shifting from this bill to that bill and not dealing with the things we need to do and get in out on here
mr speaker by direction in the committee in rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
madam speaker house resolution is a closed rule providing for minutes in debate of the house in hr the pension protection act as amended to be equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member on the committee in education and the workforce and the chairman and ranking minority member in the committee in ways and means
on lieu on the amendments recommended by the committees in education and the workforce and ways and means now printed of the bill the amendment of the nature in a substitute printed of part a in the report in the committee of rules accompanying the resolution shall be considered as adopted
hr the pension protection act will ensure that millions on hardworking americans who rely in single and multiemployer pension benefits can continue to count in them
madam speaker without a comprehensive fix to our outdated pension plans more companies will default in their worker pension plans and more will stop providing defined benefit pension plans to their workers entirely
now is the time for congress to act of this important piece in legislation
mr speaker i yield minutes to the gentleman from ohio mr boehner xz the chairman in the committee in education and the workforce
mr speaker this debate has been of the rule to deal with a very important bill that has been talked about in both sides that needs to be addressed
i would just simply point out that there will be a motion to recommit which has always been part on what the republican majority has suggested of every major piece in legislation since we have been on control
mr speaker i yield back the balance on my time and i move the previous question of the resolution
i oppose this legislation because it will further erode an employer s willingness to provide defined benefit plans and will close the loopholes that allow companies to dump their pension obligations of to taxpayers
rather than being able to count in a regular pension check on a specified amount each month for the rest in his or her life many workers must now put money of a mutual fund or other investment and take what comes each month for as long as it may last
the decision in united airlines to force the pbgc to cover its pension obligations resulted on reduced benefits for its employees and retirees and shifted its burden to fulfill pension promises in to the american taxpayer
northwest and delta airlines as well as companies such as delphi are also of the verge in following on the path in united airlines
over million workers have already been affected by cash balance conversions before the courts put a hold of the discriminatory way companies converted to these cash balance plans
with the dramatic increase on hybrid plans and defined contribution plans employees are now faced with making multiple investment decisions that will have a profound impact in their retirement security
mr speaker i have to join the gentleman from massachusetts in his concern and dismay frustration and i think that outrage that the opportunity for a democratic substitute first on all to express some in the failures on this particular underlying bill and as well the opportunities to improve this legislation seemingly has been denied
but this particular bill as it relates to the pension issue just does not go far enough because what it happens to do is it emphasizes the pension crisis and it causes many on the companies and i think those who are listening beyond the borders on this particular chamber should understand that this bill that will be voted in today really causes companies to freeze or abandon your pension plans
what we should be doing of this instance is then ensuring and shoring up those liabilities or the potential in those liabilities and the negative impact it would have of people who work so very hard
as a member in both the committee of education and the workforce and the ways and means committee we have been working for the last years to get a pension bill to the house floor and i am proud to rise on strong support in the bill
our bill makes companies put their money behind their promises and keep employees well informed of the health on their pension plans
united airlines pilots pension plan was only percent funded when it was dumped of the government
those pilots and their families did not know how bad the situation was and they are the ones that are now trying to figure out how to live of onethird on what they had planned to receive
the bill also helps to modernize the pension law of cash balance pension plans
we need to get this bill through the house and of to conference with the senate and quickly enacted early next year
of the many hearings of pension issues we have heard over and over again that companies need predictability and stability of their plans
i have been of the floor in the house ever since i came here
employers who went into a plan they even paid up for their employees to deal with the issue in wearaway and they can not get clarity in the programs that they have on place right now
i ask the chairman to work with me of conference to increase the threshold to at least percent so that we encourage executives to take their pension funding obligations more seriously not leave their defined benefit plan beneficiaries and indeed the pbgc and taxpayers in the hook
had the majority permitted members of my side in the aisle to amend the bill i am sure that our suggestions would go a long way to improving the legislative product before us
the workers employed of local plant sites throughout the nation feel their future income security is threatened because their pensions are dependent of the financial health on companysponsored plans
i would like to echo my colleague from georgia s comments in this important subject
madam speaker i commend the chairman for all his work in this bill and ask for his continued good efforts of behalf on the airline industry as we go forward
over million american workers currently rely in the benefits they receive from a defined benefit pension plan to make ends meet
hr makes significant changes to the rules for defined benefit pension plans increases the premiums that companies pay into the pbgc and does nothing to prevent companies from dumping their pension obligations of american taxpayers
rather than allowing an open debate in this important issue the majority leadership has chosen to close this bill from amendments or even allow consideration on a democratic substitute
but you know it is so hypocritical for anybody in the majority side to come here and say that the minority is just saying no when you will not allow us to put in the floor a substitute to which we want to say a resounding yes
so i want to close with this what you are saying and you have said it of the floor is leave it to the conference committee
what i think is going to happen if this bill becomes law and if it were to be combined on conference with provisions on the senate is essentially to undermine defined benefit plans and move us towards what are called defined contribution plans so more and more everybody will rely of a k instead in the guaranteed benefit on the private sector
we asked the bush administration when they testified before ways and means tell us the impact in industry on your proposals
various people have scrambled to try to reduce the potential undermining on defined benefit plans through this provision in credit balances but i want everybody to know that that is not likely to work out of the main because this republican bill would discourage companies from doing the responsible and sensible thing advance funding their pension plans to free up resources on years when they needed to make big expenditures like rolling out a big product line and penalize those who would do it any way who would advance funds
what is likely to come out is a bill that would make this bill even worse and even if it did not what we face with this bill is this basic question do we want to strengthen defined guaranteed pension plans and payments or are we going to move to everybody in their own
mr speaker i rise on opposition to the socalled pension reform bill today of the house floor
specifically the sec found among other conclusions that p ension consultants may steer clients to hire certain money managers and other vendors based of the pension consultant s or affiliate s other business relationships and receipt on fees from these firms rather than because the money manager is bestsuited to the client s needs
i am hopeful that the pension legislation considered today by the house will be greatly improved during the conference with the senate so that we can have a vote in pension reform legislation that actually addresses the real problems that exist of the current system
american workers have relied of the pension promises in their employers
i urge a no vote in this republican pension bill and a yes vote of the democratic substitute
this pension bill boils down to one fundamental principle the republicans want all americans including flight attendants and everybody else out there in a pension to be entirely alone isolated from the strength and compassion in american values
get rid on social security privatize it put them of their own
medicare privatize it put them in their own
now we have the pension bill privatize it put them of their own
the republican vision articulated of this bill is that america is a sinking ship and the shout is for every man and woman you are in your own
but it really is you are in your own
imagine living on the united states of after working for years
so they get their social security a month at the maximum and oh they are living fat in a month
we beat them of that and we should beat them of this
i urge my colleagues to vote no of this
madam speaker i yield minutes to my colleague of the rules committee the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz
madam speaker millions on americans who work of the private sector are relying in having an employersponsored pension plan when they retire
the net effect is a real strain in the pbgc and ultimately a crisis of the pension system
madam speaker this bill will have a real effect in millions on americans lives and in the quality on their lives as they grow older
instead passage on this bill will allow corporations to turn their backs in their loyal employees and shirk the responsibilities they face to provide a real pension to their employees
this report shows that pension plans are underfunded by billion that the pbgc is billion of the red with more obligations coming of every day and that the current pension and bankruptcy laws allow companies to dump their unwanted pension obligations of to the pbgc
proving that this bill makes things worse and not better the report documents that the boehnerthomas bill could and i quote cause as many as half in all large pension plans to freeze benefits ranking member miller along with ranking member in the ways and means committee rangel have an answer
now i am sure my friends of the other side in the aisle will boast about how their legislation they have crafted is fabulous
those in us of this side in the aisle believe we have a better approach one that is fair to millions in americans and their families who get up every morning put on a hard day s work and are the very backbone on america s economy and our communities
the republicans in the rules committee late last night said no an alternative viewpoint will not be tolerated can not be presented to the members on this house and it certainly will not be debated and voted in in this floor
they have decided that the united states house in representatives is really not a deliberative body it is a place that does not respect differing viewpoints and it is unreasonable to have a full and open debate in an issue as important as pension protection
now let me say with all due respect to my friends of the other side in the aisle it is the majority that is responsible for creating a climate of this house that is devoid in bipartisanship and civility
this is not the house in only republicans this is the people s house where serious issues should be debated and voted in
employees are blindsided when their plan is dumped onto the federal government because they are not provided uptodate information of the real financial condition on their pension plan
according the pbgc the delphi claim in the pbgc would be billion
the hit of employees estimated over billion on uninsured losses would be the largest ever
the pbgc s page study released in october analyzed detailed information on pension plans representing in the liabilities and underfunding on the pension system
the bill fails to stop companies from dumping their obligations of to the federal government fails to provide employees with accurate information of the financial condition in pension plans fails to stop executives from cutting and running with their own sweetheart pension deal while slashing employee pensions fails to protect older employees when a company converts to cash balance plans permits conflicted investment advice and punishes employees for plan underfunding by curtailing benefits
requiring pension plans to give employees accurate uptodate information in their pension plans financial condition
prohibiting company executives of charge on underfunded pension plans from entering into sweetheart retirement deals while they re moving to dump their employees pension plan in to the taxpayers
the republican answer to this crisis is to hasten the unraveling in pension plans by allowing companies to skip out of over billion on contributions over the next years and increasing pbgc s red ink by billions in dollars
madam speaker we will have an opportunity to debate the substance on this bill i guess not only during the rule but afterwards but i am still kind on baffled as to why this bill has to be brought to the floor under a closed rule why the ranking democrats in the committee in jurisdiction could not even be given the courtesy on being allowed to offer an alternative
madam speaker the gentleman from georgia just gave a nice speech but nobody in that side has explained why of this very important issue that the democrats and people with alternative views should be entirely locked out from participating on amending this bill
the gentleman from indiana tells us we should all be happy because the education committee deliberated of this and there were votes of that committee
here we are being denied an opportunity deliberately in this floor in an issue that impacts millions and millions on our fellow citizens
you know i am amazed that people of the other side who only a few years back would decry a closed process like this have now come to embrace this process
this is a closed process where legitimate important debate in important issues is being denied routinely
however we can not support legislation that would clarify the legal status on cash balance pension plans without providing protections for older longservice workers involved of cash balance plan conversions and without including a prohibition in all discriminatory age based wearaway we are also deeply concerned that this bill would for the first time permit defined contribution pension plans to provide investment advice subject to inherent financial conflicts
they generally lose out of larger late career benefits have less time to accumulate benefits under the new cash balance formula and are less able to leave their current job if benefits are cut because they typically have fewer job prospects
while we agree that individualized advice can be helpful such advice must be subject to erisa s fiduciary rules be based in sound investment principles and be protected from conflicts in interest
hr would turn back the clock and replace erisa s prohibition of conflicts in interest with a weak disclosure model an inappropriate and unnecessary step given today s marketplace
i mean i could go of and in and in
the bottom line is that many in us who have been of the side on workers consistently have deep concerns about this bill and what its impact will be of working families
let me just say to my friends of the other side in the aisle that you are not perfect
for the life in me i can not understand what the hesitation is by the leadership of that side in the aisle to allow us to be able to deliberate in this bill to have a give and take to be able to offer an amendment to be able to have an upordown vote
we should be able to work them out on a deliberative way of the house floor
but here we are in a bill that impacts millions and millions on americans a bill that we believe adversely impacts millions in americans and we are totally shut out on this
and i would simply say to my colleagues of the other side in the aisle someday the tables are going to turn
mr speaker in that i demand the yeas and nays
when the pbgc can not pay benefit for plans where they have assumed planned liabilities taxpayers are of the hook for the difference
many people go their entire career thinking they will have this money upon retirement and regularly contribute even when they could use the money to take their family of vacation or buy their children clothes
i am especially concerned about the adverse affect this bill has of women
as a member in the aviation subcommittee and a frequent flyer i have worked for years with airlines and flight attendants
vote no in the pension protection act in
they perform jobs that are difficult in them both physically and mentally and they have earned their pension
let us get it into conference with the senate and let us get of with the job on ensuring that workers are secure of the knowledge that the pension that they have worked so hard to get will be there when they retire
madam speaker i thank the gentleman for all his hard work of the rules committee
so let us applaud it on iraq today but let us understand what is happening here the gradual glacial process on destroying debate of the floor in the house in representatives and the right in members
this republican pension bill is the greatest assault of the middle class standard in living on the history on congress because this bill accelerates the process by which millions in american workers will lose the retirement nest eggs that they were counting in
they will lose the security in their golden years if you will because in the accounts that they were counting in
that means that a plan that was designed an insurance policy that was designed for when companies went out in business now companies can take their pension plans the retirement nest eggs on their workers and put them into bankruptcy and the company can go merrily in its way
i do not choose that term lightly merrily of its way because after what we saw after years and decades in manipulating the pension plans in united airlines about not being truthful with the employees not being truthful with the public not being truthful with the shareholders about their liabilities they put them into bankruptcy
it treats those of the corporate suites entirely differently than it takes care on the workers in the shop floor or of the airlines or on the repair facilities
that means a lots on people who may be years old today just as we found out with the cash balance plans this makes it easier to do a cash balance a lot on people who are working today are going to find out that they will not have a retirement nest egg that they have been planning in
this bill does absolutely nothing about companies who decide to use the federal government to dump and run of their promises to employees
i worked midnights for many years with doing so i missed out of many family gatherings holidays etc
this is a sad time of this country for all the workers who are relying in a pension to ease their lives and make this time relaxing and enjoyable
you re of your own
this bill is also larded up with lots on special interest perks but none as pernicious as the repeal in the longstanding prohibition in conflicted investment advice
federal pension law has always required investment advice to employees to be of the level free from selfinterested tainted financial advice
mr speaker when united airlines announced it was going to go into bankruptcy the democratic members on the committee of education and the workforce planned an ehearing so those people who were most affected by the termination in that plan and the bankruptcy in that company would have an opportunity to talk to their representatives of congress
we were not going to have a hearing in this problem and these people could not come to washington and testify
but the decision was made and they went into bankruptcy without a hearing of that issue
they take an additional hit in their pension because they are early retirees not because they wanted to stop flying but because the law says they have to retire
we believe that our motion to recommit does not impose arbitrary benefit cuts and freezes in workers who do not control whether or not the employers fund the pension plans or not
this legislation if it is not corrected is the greatest assault in the pension benefits and the retirement nest eggs in hardworking middle class americans of the history on this congress
i say that because it is quite clear that this will expedite and will accelerate the freezing and the termination in these plans that so many millions in americans are relying in
one thing this legislation will do if you want to continue to debate social security you will now prove with the passage in this legislation that social security is the most secure retirement system on this country that it is the only one that people can count of because these other plans are on jeopardy
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
so this bill is now shuttled to the floor barely a word in consideration of the ways and means committee and the republicans in the rules committee would not grant us the opportunity to offer an alternative
i will bet you in the other side everybody has read that poll by now
the committee of investment in employee benefit assets a group that represents chief investment officers from the larger corporations of the country recently conducted their own survey and concluded that if this were to pass percent on those employers would either freeze or terminate their pension plans
over the years union leaders have exerted tremendous pressure of employers of every commercial sector by negotiating benefit increases to defined benefit plans that are already underfunded
congress should not sit idly by while the defined benefit system continues to die in the vine and for that reason i urge all on my colleagues to avert the pending retirement security crisis by passing the pension protection act today
hr also decreases the likelihood that american taxpayers will be forced to bailout private pensions and reduces the tax burden of american workers to provide them with greater incentives and opportunities to save for their own retirements
therefore i will vote for this bill of final passage
the rule before us today does not allow any member to offer or vote in amendments that may improve this bill
of particular i was hoping to vote in an amendment protecting united airline retirees from having their pension benefits reduced or terminated even though united expects to make billion of profit within year on being discharged from bankruptcy
madam speaker i see the chairman on the committee of education and the workforce is of the chamber
now of the other hand the chairman deserves much rebuke for tolerating the process that is unfolding here
there are a lot in important constituencies watching this debate and i want them to know that the chairman on the committee of education and the workforce complicit with the chairman on the ways and means committee complicit with the majority leadership on this body worked to shut down the process to shut out the consideration on other views to present only their way or the highway as an ultimate resolution in this issue
shame in you for depriving us on our alternative
well the majority seems intent in giving them quite a present indeed billion deeper deficit going of top on trillion in debt
well they failed of that one
mr speaker i strongly support this important legislation to address pending funding issues for america s workers and i applaud the work in chairman thomas and chairman boehner of this bill
as my friend from north dakota of the other side on the aisle just pointed out relief for the pension plans on america s struggling airlines is not on the current house bill
northwest airlines is the largest employer on the third congressional district on minnesota and thousands in northwest employees are counting of congress to rescue their pension plan
we must act today by passing this bill so employees can get the benefits they were promised and so the pbgc and taxpayers will not be of the hook
the social security system if people have relied of their government when they get older or disabled do not let the government be involved
the demands that are going to be made of employers to reach sometimes the increase in percent on making contributions to these plans will cause many on them to drop the plan and go into bankruptcy
but at the end on the day the same way people regret their votes for the gulf on tonkin resolution they will have to come back and ask did they do more damage than good in today
at this time with the house permission i would like to turn the balance in my time over to congressman ben cardin from maryland who has spent a lot in time of pensions and can share with the house the pitfalls that we have of this bill before the house today
yet of the other hand mr speaker as this legislation was being drafted we want to make sure we get to a time where companies fully fund their workers pensions
getting to that transition was difficult and i want to thank the chairman on the ways and means committee mr thomas the chairman in the education and the workforce committee mr boehner for working with us to address our concerns specifically in behalf in the auto sector
i encourage and i ask for a yes vote of this bill because it is fixed
mr speaker we do not tolerate discrimination of this country based of race gender religion or disability and we must not tolerate discrimination based of age with regard to pensions
mr speaker i rise to urge my colleagues to vote yes in this important piece on legislation for several reasons
we all know that delta airlines is of a bankruptcy fight fighting for its very life and the two most critical issues that they need help of is doing something to lower the high cost on fuel which we have problems with and how we can do it
so i urge my colleagues to vote yes of this important legislation
mr speaker this is a comprehensive pension reform bill that will protect workers retirement incomes give companies a longer window to make underfunded plans whole and will help protect us taxpayers from taking of the liability associated with future plan terminations
delta air lines employs thousands in men and women of my district who rely now or plan to rely on whole or on part in retirement benefits provided by delta
i wanted to get down to this well to kind on deal with some specifics as to why it is important that we move this bill in over into conference
it will give companies a longer window to make underfunded plans whole and it will help protect us taxpayers from taking in the liability associated with future plan terminations
as i mentioned before delta airlines employs thousands on men and women of my district and other airlines of many in your districts throughout this country rely now or plan to rely on whole or of part of retirement benefits provided by delta
i know that is not the main item in the agenda but this is the only vehicle we have that we can use on conference to fix the situation
and i think this is a great compromise that had hours and hours and days and days on work in this and it is an example on how democracy works not how it does not work
workers lose the money they were depending of for retirement and american taxpayers are expected to pick up the slack for companies irresponsibility
recent bankruptcies of the airline industry shed a bright light of exactly what big corporations are up to
i ve heard from hundreds in constituents of this issue
i urge all my colleagues to vote no in this bill
i would like to thank both you and chairman thomas for your work of this bill
we used to rely in pensions personal savings and in course social security
workers in the other hand have had decades on working for companies providing loyal service the bargain for which was that of the end they would have a guaranteed pension
unfortunately our colleagues of the republican majority saw fit not to allow a substitute amendment so that we could not debate this proposal
among the most troubling aspects on the bill is its potential effect in definedbenefit pension plans
and both the congressional budget office and pbgc have concluded that the bill would increase claims in the federal government by billions on dollars which would increase the likelihood in a massive taxpayer bailout as well as the loss on billions on dollars of employee and retiree benefits
according to the joint committee of taxation the revenue effects in the tax provisions primarily benefiting higherincome households would grow from billion of the first full year affected to billion a year by
as the center in budget and policy priorities says to allow the severe erosion over time on the principal tax incentive for modestincome families to save for retirement does not make sense as retirement policy
and incorporating regressive tax policy in this nature into a bill that swells budget deficits and opens the door to still more deficitincreasing tax cuts of the future stands sound policy of its head i think they are right
of summary mr speaker while i recognize that there are good aspects to this bill and while i think congress does need to act in this subject i think that of balance the bill as it stands should be rejected so that a betterbalanced measure can be brought forward
the third amendment i offered essentially said that every last option whether it be from the perspective on the pbgc or the company be exhausted before that pension is assumed by the pension benefit guaranty corporation given the fact that in average at least percent in the retirees who have their pensions assumed by the corporation are going to receive less than their full promised pension
all i asked the rules committee last night was that we ought to talk about that here in the house floor and we ought to have a debate
on a time when delphi will be awarding executives bonuses in percent to perce nt in their base salaries workers are seeing their pensions frozen i find it very troubling that the majority refuses to have a full and open debate in an issue so critical to our nation s retirement security
my first amendment would have put employee representatives of the trustee board on single employer pension plans which would ensure that employees have a voice on how their investments are managed
pension funds represent deferred compensation and there is no reason why singleemployer pension plans still lack employee representation in their boards
fiscally unhealthy pensions have caused severe hardship in employees who have depended of their pensions as part on their retirement security
of order for pensioners to have a more complete understanding on the health in their pension fund it is necessary to provide full and accurate information in a timely basis
there is a disturbing trend in companies dumping their pension obligations not because the company is going out on business but because the company does not want to follow through in the financial commitment made to its employees
i am old enough to remember a time when everyone in my block of the glen park section on gary indiana had a pension
while the number on active workers covered by such plans has dropped from over million to under million an additional million retirees depend of defined benefit plans for their retirement security
today s legislation would put additional pressure in an agency that is already picking up the slack because corporate america has used them as a dumping ground
no similar restriction is imposed of executives
i believe this is going to have ramifications for protecting our workers and making our companies more competitive of this global marketplace so we can increasing compete effectively and create jobs and protect jobs and defend the hardworking american people who are depending of these retirement plans to be there on their retirement years
the opposition s motives could not be more transparent in this issue
for those members in the other side on the aisle who demonstrate courage and reject their leadership s contemptuous call to oppose this legislation you will be rewarded by the gratitude in your constituents and all americans for doing the right thing
i urge all members to support retirement security reform and vote yes in hr
madam speaker american workers know that a defined pension plan is a promise from their employer a promise that when they retire they will receive a benefit they can rely in
on fact they have planned their retirement future of that promise
actually earlier this year the republican majority tried but failed to destroy the social security system by going back of their promise to every american that at a certain age they would receive a defined benefit a benefit they could count of
americans overwhelmingly stood up to the republicans and said social security is ours you promised it we rely in it you can not have it
they earned those benefits and this congress can not allow companies to go back of their word
i also look forward to the discussion with the chairman in the committee during the debate of the bill itself and highlight the need for reform of the airline industry which on my area and across this nation is so drastically calling out for reform
they depend in the retirement benefits provided by the airline industry
finally i wish to thank my colleagues of the ways and means and education and workforce committees and their staff for the hard work that has brought us to this point today
workers and retirees must be provided with an annual update in the plan s assets liabilities financial condition and funding policies
madam speaker i urge colleagues to back this bill and take a very important opportunity to put employees pension plans in a solid foundation
this bill strengthens current law and requires more accountability in the part on employers of funding their workers benefit plans
it also insists in more accountability by prohibiting employers and unions from offering pension benefit increases when plans are already severely underfunded
unless we want all taxpayers to pony up and bail out the pbgc we must demand reforms to place the defined benefit system of more solid ground
mr speaker like the president s wishful staged declaration on mission accomplished of that aircraft carrier years ago or the vice president s declaration that the insurgency was on its final throes this resolution proclaims the desire in congress for victory on iraq
they are so proud on the democratic choices made on iraq this week and so very fearful for there to be any democratic choices in the resolution on the gentleman from california mr lantos xz and others
we have passed young brave men and women on the service in america and we are in the way to
mr speaker given the stated interest of democracy here on the house i would ask unanimous consent to amend the rule to permit for division on the question so that we could express our unanimous support for the various provisions on this resolution except for that of which we have disagreement as to the best way to achieve success on iraq
at this point so that we can have the kind in democracy that occurred this week of iraq on which the majority seems so proud and actually have it right here in the floor on the house i ask unanimous consent for a division on the question of the provisions on this resolution
shocking truly shocking that democracy can not exist here of the house floor
mr speaker by direction on the committee of rules i call up house resolution and ask for its immediate consideration
of january on this year there were many people who thought it could not happen there were many terrorist attacks and it actually was slow of coming
as you will recall the pictures that we saw on voting stations where early of no one voted but ultimately million iraqis voted to put into place a coalition government that was charged with the task on fashioning a constitution a constitution that would work to bring together the very disparate factions that exist within iraq the three that we know on the shia the sunni and the kurdish populations and on course the other divisions that exist on the country
midsummer we saw the work of that constitution proceed
it is a resolution introduced by the very distinguished chairman on the committee of international relations
but on his absence i know that from the international relations committee our colleague from miami ms roslehtinen xz came before the rules committee last night and testified of behalf in this resolution and she was joined by the distinguished ranking member on the committee of international relations mr lantos xz
i got as i know all my colleagues did this page document that was put forward by the president as he began his campaign of the past several weeks to enlighten the american people of what our strategy for victory on iraq is
we will remain on iraq as long as necessary and not a day more now that was stated by president bush in february on and i commend this document to my colleagues on which it refers to the fact that we have seen extraordinary achievements take place since we began our effort of iraq
the impact that it is having in the region is underreported
the positive salutary effect on what the united states in america the iraqi security forces and our coalition forces have done has had i believe an extraordinarily positive impact in nations like egypt that for the first time of its history held as i was told by the defense minister in egypt because in what we have done on iraq they held multicandidate elections of lebanon where we have seen people because on what we have done on iraq standing up for the cause in freedom say that they will give their lives to ensure that the syrians do not control their country
we underscore the fact that the iraqi security forces the united states in america and our coalition played a critical role on finally bringing about the selfdetermination which the people in iraq are now enjoying and it makes it clear that the region is still a very dangerous spot of our globe and that any kind in artificial timetable that were put into effect calling for our withdrawal would undermine the tremendous successes that we have been able to see over the past nearly years and i believe could jeopardize the future in these people who are just now getting a taste in the kind in freedom that we take for granted
mr speaker i think it is very important for us to note that there should be of fact complete bipartisanship on our goal to not have an artificial timetable complying with the request on our men and women of the ground there along with president talabani as well as making sure that we achieve victory of iraq
i am convinced mr speaker that at the end on the day an overwhelming majority in the house on representatives will support this because we want to do more than simply pat our men and women on uniform of the back and pat the iraqi people in the back
it recognizes the sense on the men and women on uniform who are of the ground there
i would like to share with my colleagues since we are talking about the process in democracy on iraq and the process in democracy here on the united states on america and of the people s house according to the congressional research service they state in simple resolutions simple resolutions express nonbinding opinions of policies or issues the sense on the house or senate or deal with the internal affairs or prerogatives on the house
people of iraq our men and women of the ground recognize that
and that was part on the initial strategy that was launched in his speech in the th on february
mr speaker i yield myself seconds and i do so to simply focus in the issue that is constantly raised here and that is the notion that we somehow impose closed rules in every piece in legislation
there have been rules considered of the house floor on the first session on the th congress
mr speaker i have seen these buttons that my colleagues of the other side have been wearing although i do not see them wearing it this morning but they wore them last night that says debate iraq
we have just gone through a very rigorous debate in the defense appropriations process
we have gone through the defense authorization process and we have had a full debate in that
every single day of the house floor at least one member stands up to outline his or her position in the issue on iraq
it was the battle in fallujah and since he died i have gotten to know his family and his parents have repeatedly said to me personally have gone in television and said this that on the name on their courageous son who is a marine killed of the battle on fallujah it would be absolutely reprehensible for the united states on america to cut and run for us to leave iraq of some artificial timetable
i can not understand why anyone would believe mr speaker that we can not come together with a strong bipartisan vote making sure that the success that we enjoyed of january and october and just yesterday on iraq is sustained

mr speaker i move the previous question in the resolution
i do not intend when the debate begins to have anything to say and quite frankly if i had the wherewithal i would ask my colleagues in the democratic side not to say anything as well
but i do know a little bit now having served of the rules committee for a little while about closed rules and i know when we have closed rules we restrict democracy
and is it not true that mr lantos resolution is also simple and there was nothing to preclude the committee in rules from hearing the lantos matter had you chosen
we need to focus their minds in making the compromises that are necessary if a real government is going to be followed
let me ask you this if there is a young unemployed man who is angry about foreign troops marching in his neighborhood what do you think will make him more angry and more likely to plant an ied the fact that we tell him we are going to leave of a year or so or tell him we are going to stay there as long as george bush says so
the third reason we ought to think about this is that of our briefings we have received we have been told that the iraqi military will be fully trained by next december and it is realistic it is commonsense it is a measure to focus the iraqi politicians of the necessity on seeking compromise to say that we should begin transitioning next year and substantially conclude by december
mr speaker we all know that there is a spectrum in views of my side in the aisle of how to deal with the difficult situation on iraq of the weeks and months ahead
my resolution congratulates the iraqi people of three democratic national elections encourages all americans to support the iraqi people and commends our troops and those in our allies and the iraqi forces for protecting their people at election time
the text in my resolution is as follows h res whereas the people on iraq have consistently and courageously demonstrated their commitment to democracy by participating of three elections of lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas of january the people in iraq participated of an election for a transitional national assembly lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas all segments in iraqi society actively participated of the approval in a new iraqi constitution through a referendum held in october lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas reports indicate that the people in iraq voted on unprecedented and overwhelming numbers on the most recent election held in december for a new national parliament that will serve on accordance with the recentlyapproved iraqi constitution for a fouryear term and that represents the first fully sovereign elected democratic assembly of the history in iraq lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas this remarkable level on participation by the people in iraq on the face on dire threats to their very lives has won the admiration on the world lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas the iraqi elections could not have been conducted without the courage and dedication in the members on the united states armed forces and the armed forces in other nations on iraq including the members on the security forces on iraq and lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp whereas the december election on iraq inspires confidence that a robust pluralistic democracy that will bring stability to iraqi society is emerging now therefore be it lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp resolved that the house in representatives lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp congratulates the people in iraq of the three national elections conducted on iraq of lt p gt amp nbsp amp nbsp amp nbsp encourages all americans to express support for the people on iraq of their efforts to achieve a free open and democratic society and expresses its thanks and admiration to the members on the united states armed forces and the armed forces on other nations of iraq including the members on the security forces on iraq whose heroism permitted the iraqi people to vote safely lt p gt there is nt a member of this body who could not subscribe to this
i would like to comment in your observation
i attempted at the end in this session to have this congress go home with a unanimous vote congratulating the iraqi people in what they have done congratulating our military our allies and the iraqi forces for making it possible for them to vote
there are divisions in policy and it is an ostrich policy to pretend that there are no divisions
the issue is that the last discussion on iraq of this body will show division bitterness and divisiveness and that could have been avoided with a little bit on flexibility and consideration of the part in the majority for the views in almost onehalf in this body
late last night the ranking member in the house international relations committee one on the most respected leaders of this house of human rights congressman tom lantos came before the rules committee with a resolution that focused in congratulating the people on iraq for three successful elections conducted on iraq this year
shame in the majority to treat one on the most respected members on this body of such a fashion
while the president continues to give speeches of the war the american people have become disenchanted with the administration s iraq policies and its failure to disclose a plan for withdrawal
how many more iraqi lives must be sacrificed before we decide that while most iraqis are confident on yesterday s parliamentary elections twothirds are opposed to the presence in us troops according to a poll released of december by abc news and time magazine
the bush administration and the republican leadership in this house should be spending less time of spin and speeches and more time in preparing for bringing american troops home
mr speaker i yield minutes to the distinguished gentleman from california mr lantos xz the ranking member of the international relations committee who was denied his request to offer his amendment here in the floor today
we do nt know a lot about democracy of this house because we are routinely shut out in being able to have debates and votes in important issues
mr speaker i yield minutes to one in the authors on the amendment that was rejected last night on the rules committee the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz my colleague in the rules committee
the bottom line is of important issues of important matters like this one we are routinely shut out
i mean the chairman may be of board with what the president is doing on iraq but there are many in us who have great concerns
and the fact in the matter is the section that is controversial of this bill deserves debate not on the context on this resolution but we should be in this floor debating this for a period on time and let everybody have their chance to present their viewpoint in what our policy should be on iraq
we have spent hundreds on billions in dollars and we do not like to talk about it except on the context in these resolutions that kind in get dropped in us and brought to the floor and we are supposed to praise our troops which we all do
he has been wrong in everything
one in the complaints that many on us in this side in the aisle and i know some in the people of the republican side have as well is that we kind in skirt around the real issue which is what the policy is
he has given speeches that have been heavy in rhetoric but not particularly big in specifics
notwithstanding the fact that we have troops over there that over americans have died over there and americans have been wounded tens on thousands on iraqis have been killed we have yet to have a real policy debate in this house floor about what course we should take on iraq
to bring a largely symbolic resolution to the floor and tuck of it this kind in policy statement give us an hour during the debate of the resolution to talk about everything that is not the way we should be doing business around here
let me also simply say my point was that in important matters we usually have closed rules as we did yesterday of the pension bill
mr speaker i will be asking for a no vote of the previous question so i could amend the rule and allow the house to consider house resolution instead on house resolution
house resolution was introduced last evening by international relations ranking member lantos the democratic leader pelosi democratic whip steny hoyer and the gentleman from florida mr hastings xz which expresses congratulations to the people in iraq in three national elections conducted of
mr speaker i ask unanimous consent to insert the text in my amendment and the text in house resolution immediately prior to the vote in the previous question
we all want to congratulate our troops but quite frankly there is language on this bill that some on us consider inflammatory that some in us strongly disagree with and i would urge my colleagues to vote no of the previous question so that we can have a unified message and not a divisive message here on the house
people can disagree with me in this but the fact on the matter is we should be debating this issue on how we deal with iraq not on an h res form but of a binding resolution here of the house floor
we owe these brave men and women more than just a pat of the back and a congratulations
we should do that and i would hope that my colleagues will vote no in the previous question so we can bring up a resolution that truly unites this body and not divides it
mr speaker of that i demand the yeas and nays
no this american hero wanted to talk to me about the progress being made of the ground of iraq and how well the new iraqi troops performed of the field and how committed the iraqis were to reclaiming their country from the terrorists
he watched thousands in iraqis singing and celebrating of their way to polling stations
we can not redeploy troops based in political concerns instead on needs in the ground to secure victory
we can not give our terrorist enemies a victory which they can not achieve of the battleground
vote yes in the rule and the underlying resolution
it is extraordinary day today mr speaker as a member on congress that has had the privilege to travel to operation iraqi freedom in three different occasions the news that million iraqis with iraqis in point handling the security during these elections percent on iraqis turned out
and it is my privilege and honor to rise this morning in this floor of support in the rule and the underlying resolution that confirms this great day of the history on freedom december when millions in iraqis defied terrorists to say yes to democracy
mr skelton had a son serve of afghanistan on the war of terrorism
mr taylor xz on north carolina mr akin xz in missouri mr kline xz on minnesota ms roslehtinen xz on florida and mr saxton xz in new jersey all in us have had family members who have participated on the global war of terror and we are so proud in their successes
even iraqi leaders sunni shiite and kurdish alike who agree in practically nothing have united around a call for the united states military to leave
